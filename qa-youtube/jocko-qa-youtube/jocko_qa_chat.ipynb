            " This is Jockel Podcast number 384 with Echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, Ego. Good evening. I was studious by nature and I had read considerably about the war. I knew that the careless way in which we fired our guns and dropped bombs in France was hurting lots of people. The average time in which a British soldier was still able to fight after he landed in France was three months, killed, wounded, gasped, captured, something put them out of action in an average of 90 days. So I enlisted with my eyes open, expecting to get killed, but hoping to have done more than my part before I got mine. I was young enough that I had a desire to be something great when I died. So that my parents would receive a posthumous reward of some sort of metal and know that Bob had died bravely. But I did have ideas about the way I was to die if I must. And none of these ways was with a bayonet or a knife in my ribs. I had an antithopie toward cold steel entering my body and trained hard to learn all I could about bayonet work. In fact, all through the war, I trained just as hard as I would for an important athletic contest. I often thought that might be out in no man's land or meeting some form of an attack where I would come upon hand-to-hand fighting with a German. And he might be one of the great old German strong men of whom I had read. I knew that they would have much more strength in my slender frame possessed. And in order to remain among the living, I had to acquire skill to win such a battle. I not only worked hard during the training time, but I talked to every man I met who had experienced hand-to-hand work at the front so that I could learn any tricks there were. These tricks did save my life later in the war. I must explain here that although I expected to die in the war, I knew that one army beat the other by greater courage or greater efficiency in fighting. The side that inflicts the greatest casualties on the other would ultimately win. Therefore, I intended to sell my life as dearly as possible and see how many of the enemy I could take with me or send before. I never got careless. I always had my gas mask. I always carried a shovel and pick with me throughout the war. Some men became tired and threw their entrenching tools away, but not I. I was the champion digger of the American army. Every time we stopped, I dug a hole. We didn't know when we stopped, the weather would be five minutes, five hours, five days or five weeks. And as long as we were there, I improved my little dugout. And I can tell of many cases in which this digging saved my life. I owe much of the fact that I am here to careful training and superb physical condition. And that right there is a little excerpt from the book. I remember the last World War, which was written by Bob Hoffman. It's a book we covered early in the podcast. Podcast number 27. So that's like seven years ago. And he wrote another book called How to Be Strong, Healthy and Happy. This is a guy that fought in the First World War. And he fought in the trenches in the First World War. And in those books, he explains over and over again, the importance of physical activity of being strong and being able to lift weights and being able to do pull ups and being able to run. And in his books, he actually complains that men were getting weak. This is in the 1930s, by the way. He goes on tirades about how men spend too much time watching motion pictures. They eat too much bread biscuits, pies, pastries and donuts. That through physical training, you could condition yourself to obtain pleasure from overcoming and defeating problems and obstacles. And that this would give you greater confidence in your own abilities. By the way, like I said, these books are written in the 30s. Bob Hoffman spread the word as widely as he could in his life. He founded the York Barbell Company, which is still around today. He started the, he started a whole media arm, which in those days meant he started muscular development magazine. He founded the York oil burner athletic club. That's what he was going. That's what he was doing. And we'd be in a much better place. I think if people actually listened to Bob Hoffman, but they didn't. And our health as a country is continued to decline. But in my old job in the Navy, we were always searching for ways to get stronger, get faster, get healthier, get better. And we tried, when I first got in, the, the, we tried what our training was, which was calisthenics and traditional physical training, military, physical training. We tried some weird combination of triathlons and body building. We played around with Olympic lifting and powerlifting, maybe even a little gymnastics. Some guys really pushed to see what worked and what didn't. What could get us ready for combat? That was the, that was what we were looking for. What would get us ready for combat? And what that means is there's an infinite number of things that combat can bring. So what can we do to get ready for just about anything? And people were trying to figure that out. One of the people that was trying to figure that out was a guy named Dave Castro. He's a CEO who deployed many times overseas, deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. He wanted to be strong, wanted to be fast, wanted to have endurance, wanted to have explosiveness. And he over time found a path for physical fitness. And he's led kind of like Bob Hoffman. He's led many people down that path, including many seals, many special operations, personal conventional soldiers, Marines, law enforcement, first responders. And on top of that, just like Bob Hoffman was trying to do, he's done that with every day, civilian human beings that just want to be better. And it's an honor to have him here with us tonight to talk about his experiences and lessons learned. Dave, thanks for coming now, man. Jocco, thanks a lot for having me. It's an honor. I'm excited to dive into all of these topics. That was a great intro, by the way. That's a powerful book. I definitely am going to pick that up and dive into it. Yeah, it's an awesome book and his other book over here, which is called How to be Strong, Healthy and Happy is this one is just combat. It's literally combat. I was looking at it yesterday. It's combat till the last page, the last page like people are getting killed. And then it ends this book, though, how to be healthy, strong, happy and healthy is, is more of a manual. And it's very interesting, you know, some of the quotes I pulled out of both of those, but it's incredible that people have been trying to figure this out and trying to teach people about this for so long. And that's what made me bring, bring, that's what made me think about those books, because this is what you've been trying to do for the last, I don't know what it's been. It's been 15 years, something like that. More almost 20, almost 20 years you've been trying to do this. Let's start at the beginning. Let me, let me say this. Before even the beginning, I want to talk about this and the path and his journey and how he was searching for the best way to get basically strong and fit and ready for combat. And exactly what you were saying, not a lot of guys acknowledge, well, honestly, prior to CrossFit, the way we were training, you, you hit it, there was triathlet, people biased towards that. There was guys who biased towards physical or just bodyweight stuff, pull ups, push ups. And then you had the bodybuilding type. And every one of those was sort of done in isolation and people, especially once you got to the teams, people gravitated towards what they wanted to do. I was a runner and that's what I excelled at in Buds and as I went to different teams, that's what I was good at. So I kind of followed that, stayed away from the heavy weights. I'm a, I'm a smaller guy. And so, and you know what's interesting, I don't know if your experience is different. But mine on the East Coast, I hardly saw anyone doing Olympic lifts. Back squats and deadlifts saw a number of guys who, especially football players or guys who athletic, who did that. But the Olympic lifts, I don't think I saw many people doing those at all. Yeah, I would, when I mentioned gymnastics, the only reason I got to throw that in there is because my commanding officer at CLT1, when I was a brand new guy, he was a gymnast. And so he, this is the first guy I ever saw doing muscle ups. On the pull up bar, remember that little bar pull up bar at CLT1? It was really nice, heavy pull up bar. And I was a new guy and I'm out there watching him going, Oh, damn, like I need to go up my game. Yeah. And he's another dude like he was jacked. Yeah. And I used to think this dude's getting his, his khakis tailored. His uniform was tailored because he had no V body in his art. His sleeves real tight. He was jacked, but he was doing muscle ups. And I remember thinking, what is that? Yeah. And then start to try and figure out how to do it on a bar. Never thought of rings, never, never would have thought of rings until, like until the CrossFit stuff started getting to the teams. I'm sure we'll get to that. But so then I, so I started deploying and I went to Afghanistan. And on my first trip to Afghanistan, we started doing combat ops and in preparation for them, I was running because that's what I defaulted to as a runner. And you'd insert hike over these mountain ranges or hike over these terrain features. You'd get to target and then you'd go really hard and then you'd come out insert or X fill out and go back. And I felt like on target and I wasn't, I didn't have enough power enough kick. I didn't feel like I was fit enough. And so naturally I was like, OK, I need to run more. I need to increase. I need to increase the amount I run. And at Bogrum, we had there was a loop around the entire base and we'd run it. He'd run it once. It was four or five miles. So naturally I need to do it twice. And so I started doing that more and I still didn't see much improvement at all on target. So I was intrigued by that. And I was doing a lot of body weight stuff too. So combining them and thinking, how can I get the most out of fitness or how can I take this next level? Every one of us in the teams has a passion. It sounds like early on your passion, a passion almost even outside of the work, but related to the work. Sounds like you got into GJC. Yep, I did. Sure enough. Mine was rock climbing. So early on when I was in the teams, I got into climbing and I just went all in. And that's what I really enjoyed doing on my off time. I'd go climbing as a lead climber, all types, ice climbing, rock climbing, boldering, big walls and you know, semiday. I just really went all in on that aspect of of the job and on a personal level. Well, Mark Twight, he was this famous climber and he had this book called Extreme Alpinism. And he talked a lot about the way he trained and the alpinists, the alpinists per mindset towards going super light and super fast in their routes and in their climbing. That really resonated with me. I saw that and I was like, OK, that's that's similar to our mindset and what we're trying to do. We're always shaving ounces and trying to go as light as possible on our missions. And so that aspect resonated with me the way they approach their climbs and the way they tackled them once they were there. And this was specifically Mark Twight. This was a guy, these guys were radical what they were doing. They were insane. They were climbing peaks that would take guys four or five days in 48 hours to 24 hours. Strict because of their philosophy of super light and super aggressive and fat, light and fast, light and fast. They would they would set the records on all these routes. And a lot of it, it wasn't just for the fact of doing it quickly. It was for safety too. The faster you get up and down the mountain, the safer you are ultimately. And I read this book yet. It was Extreme Alpinism and he talks about his training and it was long slow L LSD, long slow distance stuff. Go out for three hour bike rides. Go out for two hour runs and that's how he prepped for all these endeavors. So that's in my mind. I was like, I need to do more of that to prep for this stuff. Get back from a deployment and we were able to hire him out to do some training him and his staff. And we went to Yosemite and on a training trip, we were doing some climbing with some of the other climbers on the team and a number of his world class climbers. I said, Hey, Mark, so tell me this is at dinner in the cabin after a full day of climbing. Tell me about your training. Tell me about the long slow distance stuff. And he said, I don't do that anymore. And I go, what I was blown away because I studied his books and he was an icon to me. And I'm like, what do you mean you don't do that anymore? He goes, I do something different. He goes, I do CrossFit. It's this program that's created by this guy in Santa Cruz named Greg Glasmin. I go, well, what is it? And he's like, it's body weight movements, it's pull ups, it's running, it's clean, it's dead lifts. And I was super skeptical because I'm the skeptical guy. I'm a nature. And when you look at Mark Twight, he's a, I'm a small guy. He's even smaller than I am. He was probably 155 foot 9 5 foot 8. And I was like, OK, cool. This all sounds really cool, but coming from him, I don't know if, you know, this is the right thing for a seal who's deploying to Afghanistan. And I heard him. I listened. I started researching. I started looking into CrossFit. I started looking at all the website and all the journal articles. And it was incredibly intimidating, especially because I didn't grow up with the Olympic lifts or powerlifting really or any of those movements. So the movements, I was like, man, I don't even know if I can do any of those movements. I saw stuff like Air Squats and I'm like, I can do that. I looked at a lot of things I could do and said, OK, it doesn't seem too bad. But I didn't buy it. And especially because his, he was the guy who exposed me to it. So I sat on it for a while, researched it, actually ended up deploying again. And even on deployment in the room where we had internet, I was sitting at one of the computers, I'd sit at the computer every night and check out the work out of the day. Still not. What years has it? This is three, four, three, four, three, four. Three or four, cool. Still not having done it myself yet. We had a guy who was really fit on the team and he came in and he sat down next to me. And he said, what are you looking at? And I said, oh, this is CrossFit. You should check it out. He's like, oh, what is it? And I start telling him it's this workout that combines all these different features and elements and they're really fast and and it gets you really fit. I kind of faked him out and gave him the impression that I was doing it. So he's like, awesome. I'm going to dive in. He started doing it. And I started from afar just watching how it was affecting him and the results he got from it. And he fell in love with it. And he saw a lot of results from it. And we came back from that deployment. And I still hadn't made the plunge and decided to do it. So later I ended up breaking my ankle and training. So that delayed the the effort deployed to Iraq. And on day one of being there decided, all right, I'm going all in and I started doing it. And the thing about as you know, I rack versus Afghanistan in terms of opt-empo. In Afghanistan, missions took a little longer to develop. At once a week, maybe twice a week at the max at the time we were doing missions. Iraq, you're going out every night. And so you have the potential to go out every night. And so we were on one of those every night type of situations go out, come back, hit the work out of the day from CrossFit.com, go to bed, wake up at night because we're in a nocturnal rotation and just repeat. And I started seeing great results and I fell in love with it. Interesting story there. One of the other guys I was with, he saw me doing it. And he's like, hey, I think I want to try it. I go, all right, when the next workout pops up, let's do it. And so the next day we were just following the workout of the day. The workout that popped up was a workout called Linda, three bars of death. So it's 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 of deadlift, like one and a half times your body weight, bench your body weight and clean three quarters of your body weight. And it's really one of the harder CrossFit workouts. And he did it. And as his first CrossFit workout ever on deployment, and I think he even tried going Rx, I had to scale because those weights at that time, were too hard for me to do, even though I was developing strength. So that was how I got into it into the fire, but I researched and watched for a long time before actually taking the plunge. Yeah. Oh, damn, you jumped right, right? Just to get the whole thing I was going to start with, which is like, where were you born? I'll go there. We can go there right now. So just to get us up there, where were you born? I was born in San Jose, California, 77 and where your parents, what did your parents do? My dad, he ran a trucking company. Okay. And so he had a truck yard in San Jose. And when I was in about 84, 85, we moved from San Jose to a Romas where he bought a 65 acre property. And that's the home of the CrossFit Games many years later. But he moved us out there to consolidate basically his trucking operation. And the house, so it was all co-located. And even now, so that's still in the family, both my parents have passed. My brother and I, we own that property. And that's where again, the games have been held multiple years. And I spend a lot of time there. The place means a lot to me. It's the CrossFit Ranch. Yeah. That's where it's known as. Yep. Yep. And was your dad in the military? Was your mom in the military? No, neither of them were in the military. None of, no, actually that's not true. My grandfather from my mother's side, he was in the Korean War. Okay. Yeah. So he had military experience and as a kid growing up, he had his M14 that he was able to, M1. Yeah. And underneath the bed and we'd pull it out and look at it. And he had his ribbons on the wall. So that was definitely influential. But in my inner circle, that very little military influence or connection. And you mentioned that you when you were growing up or you mentioned that you are a runner. Was that which is the sport that you did when you were in high school and everything? Well, no. So the interesting thing about the running is I didn't discover that I was a decent runner until I decided I wanted to be a seal and started following the Buds warning order. The Buds warning order was this online packet that told you how to prepare for Buds. And it had like running in PT, a running in PT program that escalated in difficulty. And once I started doing that and that was right after I graduated from high school, I realized I was a pretty decent runner and I thought I wish I would have ran in high school. Here's what I did in high school. I was on the football team for all four years. I might have started one game. I tried out for the basketball team. I didn't get picked. And I tried really hard at these things to make it to the team and like I put a lot of effort into football. And I also tried, dabbled in wrestling. That I just didn't dig it. Was into martial arts really into what martial arts? I did a screamer. So Filipino stick fighting. I did a traditional karate, traditional type one, though. UFC was like, I remember watching the early like one and two and three and those were coming up in those days into boxing as a youngster just training on my own. The martial arts formal training, the boxing on my own. The lack of success that I had in high school sports is a big part of why I decided I wanted to become a Navy seal. How do you hear about the seal teams? So the summer after I graduated from high school, 96, I went to the movies with my girlfriend at the time. We watched a movie with Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage called the rock. And you know the story in that movie, a group of Marines take over Elkatraz and then they call the baddest motherfuckers in to come save the island to save the nation from the nuclear weapons they have. And these dudes Michael Bean, like that was like the third or fourth movie being a seal and he comes in. He's the commander and these guys in all black and then they have all this cool gear. Then they insert in the water with their little mini submarines and the dude comes up out of the water with the MP5 and I'm like man, these guys are bad asses and then they come through the sewer and come out of the shower and the Marines waste them. Didn't matter. I was already heavily influenced by the black year and how cool everyone was. So I left that theater and I started researching everything I could about Navy SEALS. And I started watching all the movies, read all the books and the thing that kept returning in what I was consuming was the fact that the training was the most difficult training in the military. And at this point I had been accepted to Cal State University Monterrey Bay so I was going to college and my parents really wanted me to go to college. But that notion of the toughest training in the military, something happened. I went, I wonder if I can do that. And that was fucking it. Once I said I wonder if I can do that. I was like, I need to chase this and I need to figure it find out if I have what it takes to go through this training and become a seal. And again, I had this burden of feeling like I didn't accomplish months much athletically in high school. And I was like, and here's the thing and we know I'm saying accomplished much athletic athletic. Buds is not athletic. You do have to be in shape, but Buds is 100% a mental test. I would learn that later. I didn't realize that at that point. But so I told my parents I want to do it and they're like, no way you got to go to college. And so I said, okay. So I started school about two months into it. I had this other realization. I thought, if I don't do this now, if I finish school, because they said, hey, finish school and then do it after that. I thought I might not ever do this. Life will change. Life can change so much if I don't do this right now. I said to myself, and it's pretty funny when I think back even being 18, 19 at the time that I was able to for whatever that I thought this I thought I don't want to be 30 years old and looking back and saying I wanted to be a Navy seal at one point. I'm like, I need to do this now. I dropped out of high school and our college. Sorry. And told my parents, I'm enlisting and I enlisted. And I and that that for me, even that moment, that less that life lesson that that's been something that's meant a lot to me. And I even advise people or help people with that, just like, hey, sometimes you have to chase the dream because if you don't, if you delay it, there can be so many other things that get in the way of it ever happening. And you don't want to have that regret. But here's the thing. You have to be really measured in realistic about that. Because I think that especially with social media and a lot of messaging, there's a lot of the chase your dream and all that shit. That's really surface level and shallow. But there's a big process you have to go through in your mind and in understanding what it represents to chase it. If the timing's right, if you should rather than just recklessly chasing the dream. Yeah, because the reality is of every, you know, guy that goes, I'm going to go for 80% of them don't make it. It's probably more than that too. Like, exactly. People that actually make it to buds don't make it. So you don't have a really good chance of making it. Did you, what kind of prep did you do? Looks like you're doing this buds warning order. But the buds warning order was an online program that the NSW put out. So this was 96 97 internet was obviously around then in the early stages. And they had built out, maybe not the early stages, but it had been around for a number of years. They had built out a recommended training protocol for buds. And you did it stuck to it. I stuck to it. I would, I'm that type of person. Like if there's a training for an event or a training protocol that the events putting out, you probably should take a look at it and follow it because they're probably trying to set people up for success. Yeah. So yeah, I followed it at the time. So when you get to buds, or how was bootcamp? Was it shocked your system? We like, no, this is what I signed up for. A good to go. I'm down with folding underwear and bootcamp was a massive shock. It's specifically culturally. I grew up in California. And I remember going through the lines and I'm like, hey, what's this thing called grits? And like I have never even heard of grits. And so like I had never really left California that area my entire life. And so it was a big cultural shock for sure. One other interesting thing about that period too, especially once I went to buds, growing up in California, growing up in that area, growing up Hispanic as a Mexican. When I was applying for colleges, the messaging and everything was about, hey, make sure you tell them you're Hispanic. It's going to help you get in. It's going to help you. It's going to help you get admission. It's going to help you advance. And I was like, okay, cool. I didn't know any better. I was a kid. Once I got to the Navy to the military, once I got, especially once I got to buds, I saw that that didn't matter at all. It didn't matter what color you were. It didn't matter where you were from. What mattered was performance and the standards that they put out and that you met them and that you worked hard to accomplish those goals. So a little shock to the system and you get done with that. You check into buds. So what years are you going to get to buds? So late 97, so I graduated in 98. Okay. What was strengths and weaknesses going through buds? I think my strength was being kind of middle of the road. Like I wasn't, I didn't excel at anything. I was good at running. So that was definitely a strength like you never fell back on runs. Never fell back on runs. Not good. A weakness was swimming for sure. How about just general comfort in the water? General comfort in the water. So even now at this stage, I'll say, hey, I'm not a fast swimmer, but like, especially because of the training in all the years, I'm really comfortable in chaotic environments in the water. So being comfortable in the water that was trained into me through through that training. I didn't know I was comfortable in the water prior to buds. But oh, and I did sort of even back up. I swam a lot. And the buds warning order had a swimming protocol. I swam a lot to get ready for buds because I wasn't a swimmer through high school. And as you know, the difference between someone who has a swimming background and someone who does not, who goes to training like that, it's massive. It's Matt quick story on that. We're swimming if you don't mind. We're here for we're swimming at once. I was at a team many years later around an island in Puerto Rico. We were for we pushed Puerto Rico for a little outpost. I want to say deployment, but it's silly to say that we deployed to Puerto Rico. And so there was an island off our base, a few hundred yards away and we'd swim around it. We'd launch from the shore, swim around it and come back as a platoon. And I had been swimming a lot at the time because I wasn't a good swimmer. And I was like, okay, I want to train and I want to get better and I want to represent myself well on these evolutions. We take off and as you know in the teams, most of the swims, at least we were doing on the East Coast, we're with fins. We're going around the island and I'm in front of everybody and I'm like, all right, cool, the training's paying off. And one of our officers, I forgot his name. He was on the other on our sister platoon. He starts slowly passing me and I'm like, this is fucking awesome. I've all my works paying off because he swam in college and I'm in front of him. And as he passed me, he had no fins on him. He had no fins on and I was like, all right, that's the difference right there. We all had fins on. He had no fins on and he came out and beat everybody on the swim. Anyways, back to strengths and weaknesses. So I think it was this. My mind set the way I approached it, I think really was a strength ultimately, obviously, because I made it through in just, it sounds so silly, even when I say it, but it is powerful and how to make it through. There was a point where I woke up and I said, I still have five months of this shit. I still have five months of all this bullshit we're going through and like, how am I going to survive this? And I stopped thinking about how much time we had left to go through it. And even in workouts or in endurance stuff, I do now. I'll still sometimes stop thinking about the total duration and just think about what's in front of you. So at that point forward, all I thought about was just make it to the next meal and just make it to the next meal. And that was, I had to think sitting in the cold, sitting in the surf. All right, the next meal is going to be in three or four hours. This isn't going to be that hard. One other interesting thing about when I got there, I was one of the younger guys in the class at 1819. I was paired. My roommate was a 32 year old force recon, Gunny Sergeant. Dang. Yeah. And so talk about opposite ends of this spectrum and talk about a culture shock. And we became really good friends and spent time together and you had this guy who was a hardcore marine, ex-force recon, ex-special for, and I had just watched the rock a year earlier. So I knew everything about force recon. And so his presence was also really seeing how he handled everything and how he's just quiet and professional and how he conducted himself was a huge influence. And I don't think it was by design that one of the younger guys in the class was put with someone like that through to be a roommate. And you know, when I was not, let's say, behaving professionally as a young sailor, he was there to straighten me out. I had a, like an E5 roommate who, same thing, like he was just older, had been around. And then he quit. Well, that's where I thought you were going with that story. No, this guy stuck through. That's awesome. He made it through. Did you get rolled back for anything? No, I made it through my first time. And just again, like the middle man just making it through every evolution, didn't get injured and didn't get performance rolled. If anything, I was very close at multiple times getting performance rolled for swimming. How about like pull-comap and stuff? Were you good to go? Yeah, I mean, I mean, I might have failed once or twice, but never, like, were you get to the limits of how many times you can fail? Yeah, it sounds like you were the same as me. Like I didn't, well, you sound like you were a better runner. Maybe I was a better swimmer, but I didn't win anything. Yeah. Never, never came close to winning a run, never came close to winning a swim, never came close to winning an obstacle course. But I also never got rolled back for anything. Yeah. I failed pull-com and then I passed it. So being that what they now call, I guess they call it the gray man now, which is like, you're just, there's a lot of people in that class. And if you're kind of just blending in, you're getting the job done. Yep. It's kind of a nice place to be. You know, because as you have the loud mouse, you have the guys that stand out for being characters, you have the guys that get a lot of attention for performing poorly at everything. I just tried avoiding those extremes. I just tried staying away from that. Like, I gotta do my job. I don't want too much attention from the instructor's good or bad. Could you win the runs? Would you win a four-mile time run? We had some fast guys. Yeah, I know. So you're coming in like four to three or something like that. I couldn't win them. We had some really fast guys. Everything, I had to put out really hard to pass everything. Everything I did, I kind of had to put out hard. There was no crew. I had no crews. I don't think other than life saving. Life saving, I was not worried about. I'm like, I'm gonna kill whoever my experience on a fight him. So I was kind of fired up. Were you big then? No, I was 174 pounds when I checked into Buds. I was 185 pounds when I graduated. What about you? Remember what you were? I was in the 50s. Yeah, I was smaller than even. I was just hostile. You know, I was good at like, I'm gonna fight this dude. I saw it as a fight. So I think that helped me. So you graduate from Buds and then where you go? I go to the East Coast and I spend all my time pretty much on the East Coast. What team did you start at? Yeah. So this is funny and this is gonna be a good conversation. I've kind of drawn a line in the sand with myself as a seal professional or even on the outside now. Where like, I don't like talking about the numbers. I don't like talking about any of that stuff. Because when I was working for CrossFit, it was when I started working for CrossFit. I was still an active duty seal. And there was a couple other seals around. And I saw how Glassman and the media team kind of wanted to, I wanted to say take advantage. But highlight, right? And I was like, hey, I don't want my identity to be built around me as a seal for my exploits. So they really listened to that and they did a really good job of not highlighting. So I kind of, I told myself at that time, hey, a lot of the experiences I had and the teams I went to and the things I did, I'm not gonna talk about. Especially as I started seeing one social media came around. How met much guys did and how many lines guys crossed now. So the thing I'm trying to be at this point, I still meet people in CrossFit who come up to me and say, hey, I've been following you for 10 years and I just found out you're in AV seal. And I'm like, fucking success. You did good. Yeah, I'm like, fucking success. And so at this point, I have some of the units I've been at. I still have guys, I still get invited back to the to the reunions or to the events. I have senior leaders say, hey, thank you for for handling yourself the way you do in regards to all of that. And so even the question of what team I'm at, it's it's anyone can talk about. It's not a big deal. But for me, it's just like a personal line that I'm really trying to stay with conviction of not diving too far and going into publicly. You know, I've had people online say Dave Castro was never the seal that Jocco Goggins or whoever was. And after they said someone else and I don't know who is another public seal. And I'm like, motherfucker, you're only saying that because you know some, and no, like no offense at all, but because of how of the seal things they show and talk about. Yeah. And like, I don't want people to know what kind of seal I was, what level seal I was. And I don't, I don't want to be known as that guy. And I want to, and forgive me for like, I'm not saying you're known as that guy. It's all good, man. But, and I also want to show an example to younger seals that, hey, you can kind of transition out or get out and do something and not lean on it so much. Because I think you'll agree with me here. There's some guys that are way, I don't want to say abusive with it. But over the top. Yeah. I mean, for me, it's like, well, this is what I did for 20 years of my life. There's no like, well, hey, here's 20 years of my life. These are the lessons that I learned. This is where everything came from. That's the way it is. You know, the, the, to your point of like, well, G. Stave Castro must not have been as good of a seal as Jocco. That's just embarrassing. Yeah. Because both you and I know that there's seals that did 25 deployments. Yeah. And are the most heroic guys ever. You know, they're just outstanding. And there no one knows who they are outside the community. And that's the way they want it. And that's the way they're going to be. So that's just like a terrible thing to even think about. There's this like pop iconic culture now. Pop seals. There's like these icon seals who are and you're one of them. And I, and you know, it's funny. And it's totally fine. And I respect it. And when I'd first have these conversations with people about you or Goggins. And I would say, hey, I don't have a problem with what they're doing. It's just not the way I want to do it. And in regards to even your situation, you're exactly right. It's your experiences. And I want to say something. I just, since you decided to ask me on the podcast, I decided to pick this up. And I decided to start reading it. And I'm 100 pages in. And it's fucking great. You did a really good job with it. And, um, but for years, any of these books, any of the other ones out there, I wouldn't touch or read or even acknowledge the movies. I don't watch other than the rock. Other than the rock. That's lit too. Oh, and let's talk about Active Valorant Second. I don't want to write that down. Well, I'll talk about it now. Active Valorant Second. I think was a breaking point for a lot of these seals out there. And a huge mistake of our leadership in sending the wrong message to our community. And here's why I say that. Even before Active Valor, especially after Vietnam and Marseille era, there'd been a lot of seals who did books. Seals, even before modern era, more common than it felt like some of the other special forces Delta, you name it. Then I felt like Active Valor was this moment where we were all taking advantage of. Meaning the Navy, the command, the leadership said, we're going to take seals and we're going to put you guys in a movie and we're going to utilize your likeness to profit off of essentially to recruit with. And you're not going to get anything from it. And so you have all these guys at that time saying, well, the Navy did it with us. Why can't we do it? Why can't we do it when we get it? Why can't we capitalize on what we've done? And so I think Active Valor laid the foundation for opening up the floodgates, for sending the message to a lot of guys, hey, it's good. I'm going to get out there with it. Yeah, I don't know much about the backstory. Needed to buy. And I'd be curious of what the backstory is. I do know that here's what I know about it. They were initially going to make like some kind of a modern version of the B-Summon Special video, which was a video that I watched in 1989 that showed this really cheesy example of like what your job was in the seal teams. Yeah. And from what I understand, they initially brought a company on board to make a 20 minute, you know, hey, this is what the seal teams is. And that company came on board and said, hey, we don't, you shouldn't just make a 20 minute video. You should make an unactual feature film and we think we could do a great job with it. And for some reason, again, I don't know the backstory. Leadership said, yeah, that sounds like a good idea. I don't know why they did that. I don't know if we were having problems recruiting. I don't think we were having problems recruiting. But so I, at some point, I'll dig and see what I can find out and see why that decision got made because it certainly was a complete departure from, you know, the way that I was certainly raising the seal teams. When I was raising the seal teams, it was like, you didn't talk about it. You definitely, like, there was no stickers. There was no nothing. But that's just the way it was. And that was, you know, for me, man, when I remember, life and I who wrote extreme ownership with me, like the, I wish I would have recorded, like the first call we had with our publisher, I was such a jerk. You know, I was just like, listen, if this is going to misrepresent this and all, I was just, it was, because it was a huge step, right? And it felt uncomfortable. You know, I had one of one of my friends who wasn't admiral, was like, he said something that I was very appreciative of, which was, hey, where, where quiet professionals, that doesn't mean silent professionals. And if you have important things that should be shared, then they should be shared. And I was like, well, okay, now look, there's, you can, you can argue against that all day long. There's, there's an easy to say, yep, that's bullshit. And you shouldn't share anything. And that's absolutely a valid opinion. But that's the, that's the direction that I went in, like, hey, man, I was working with these companies and these people were falling over themselves saying, this is such good information. Thank you so much. And then it's like, well, we could really help out a lot of people if we do this. So there you go. And it, and that's balanced against the fact that when you write a book, that's about you, about, you know, I wrote, you know, life and I wrote a 300 page book. That's about us. And that's all, that's, that's all you need to say. Okay, so you're, you're touting your own horn, or whatever the case may be, yep, yeah, that's, there's no denying it. And so you do the best you can. I think we did the best we could to maintain, like, professionalism, humility, I mean, the things about, you know, as far as like classified material and stuff, that wasn't even, to me, that's just a non-starter, obviously. And, you know, for us, the combat that we were in was in front of the world. It was in daytime. It was like, there was nothing secret about what we're doing at all. You know, like, we had, when we had guys get killed, it was in the newspaper the next day. It wasn't some big secret. Their names, like, it was, that's the way it was. So we kind of felt like we were a little bit exposed anyways. But yeah, it'd be interesting to find out and pull the thread on active valor and see what the, what the thought process was behind that. Because I don't know. Even the way from what I've read, I think you guys are portraying in a great way. And everything you're saying about like your experiences and what you're, you're helping the world and giving back and giving some great leadership lessons and insight to, I have to point, millions of people, right? But there's other guys who are not. There's other guys who are just talking and telling their story and just like, some of these, some of these cats will say, I even look at, I look at what they're talking about and I look at where they're at in life. And I'm like, do that was 15 years ago. That was 20 years ago. That's another reason why I'm like, hey, I've done, but you know, this is a podcast. So of course, we're going to talk about the past. But I'm like, hey, there's a lot I've done since then. And I don't, I kind of viewed as like, I don't want to be a defined solely by then. I want to be defined what I've done since then. Yeah. Well, I definitely have talked to a lot of people about the fear of becoming Uncle Rico. Yeah. And being like, you know, the state championship, if I were to throw them, if I were to be good to go, I wouldn't want to stay. I would have gotten recruited. Like, hey, man, these are, these are, I've learned some awesome lessons. We learned some awesome lessons. Pass them on. But I mean, my life since I, I've been busier. Yeah. Since I retired than I was when I was in. Yeah. But you have a lot of, you've built a lot and you have a lot of stuff to talk about. Since then, I think some of these guys who are talking and there's a lot of them are, they don't have that, that new experience even. You know, the other thing too, though, in my situation, I also, I was in a very, people even asked me for transition advice sometimes, other team guys. And I'm actually the worst person to give that because my situation was super unique. The last three years, I was an instructor before I got out, my ninth year, but basically 12th year. And I was working full time for CrossFit. And so here I was, I was. Which is another reason you keep that stuff on the down low because you've got it all kinds of trouble. Yeah. Or maybe you had permission. I can't get permission. I had informal permission, I would say. My leadership knew, but it wasn't formally written. I was doing the CrossFit thing on the weekends because I had to fix schedule and working for CrossFit. I'm sorry, in the Navy as an instructor. So I had to make a decision to stay in. And if I stayed in, I'd go back and be operational and wouldn't be able to do the CrossFit thing or get out and work full time for CrossFit and leave the Navy. And it was a tough decision to make because I loved, if I didn't have that CrossFit opportunity, I would have stayed in for 20 for sure. I'd have been retiring around this period. But so where I'm going with that is it's easy for me to sit up here and talk all fucking bold and like, yeah, I'm not going to tell people what I did and where I was at. Because I had this nice transition. I had this huge buffer where I was able to get out and not and I was getting out with a public persona and building a new working with a new company, building it up. My transition was one of a, it was super seamless. And not two people don't get that chance too often. A lot of other guys like yourself, like you got out at 20 and then kind of had to start your thing and chose the leadership route and kind of had to build everything from there. And like you said, capitalize on and acknowledge what you did for the last 20 years. I can't say I would not have done the same if I had to get out and didn't have CrossFit. And so I do acknowledge that it was a unique situation for me. So I don't want to sound like I'm acting better than anyone else. And honestly, like everyone, again, to the kind of the free speech thing, everyone's, they can pursue whatever they want, talk about it, however they want. Share, even though some of that stuff they shouldn't share, share what they've done. It's all good. I don't care too much at the end of the day. It's just not the style I'm choosing. Yeah. Well, and also there's just a market situation at this point. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's so many incredible stories of things, guys that things, or things that guys have done from every branch of the service and there's a lot of it. I mean, 20 years of war, you're going to get some incredible stories. You're going to get some incredible lessons learned. And that's, I think, I think that's almost like a, it's become just a free market control. Is that, oh yeah, you can get out and talk about what you did in the green braze or what you talked to, what you did in the seal themes or what you did in, in Marsock or, or whatever. But if there's not something compelling there that brings something to the table for people, then the free market will just kind of say, hey, thanks. You know, appreciate, thanks for your service and move on. And I think that's happened with the number of these books, the number of these stories. There's so many seal books out there, not all of them are hitting anymore. Like you have to have, you have to have a compelling message. You have to have something with value that's going to make people really gravitate towards it and consume it. Yeah. Yeah. No, I'd say there's no doubt about that. And we went down this little freaking tangent because I was like, okay, so what teams you go to? So you go to an East Coast team. How's your, how's your, how's your, how are you like being a new guy? That's a great question. I, I mean, you don't, right? Like being a new guy isn't a pleasurable experience, but even when I got two teams, I was kind of just staying in the middle, try to say that, be the invisible man, but there it's, you quickly realize you have to, you can't. You have to stand, you have to, because it's such a smaller group because you guys up. Yeah, exactly. And you're in the, you're in the spotlight, a majority of the time. But I was quiet and I was a really hard worker and I wanted, I wanted to prove myself. Even, even now, but even then, I felt like I had something to prove, even now I still feel like I have something to prove. And so working hard, mattered and, and showing my leaders and not even my leaders, but the guy to the left and right of me that I was a good contributor and ultimately a good warrior meant a lot to me. And so I worked really hard and tried to, tried to excel at everything I did, even though I wasn't winning everything I did, I tried to win everything I did. Well, people can tell when you're trying and it's hard to win stuff when you're a new guy. Now look, you might win a run, you might want to swim because you're coming out of buds, you're in good shape, but it's, it's tough to be the guy in shooting, it's tough to be the guy in, in anything tactical, but they can tell when you're, when you're working hard. So this is still pre 9-11, right? Yeah. And on that note, it's still pre 9-11. And I have a ton of respect for every seal, anyone in the military who enlisted after 9-11. I did not, you did not, we, we basically enlisted in peace time. And I'd like to say, I mean, I think I would have, I know I would have, but it's still, it takes a little more knowing that after 9-11, if you enlisted and came into these career fields, you were probably going to war. Well, I did technically, I thought I was going to NAM when I enlisted. And I remember one of my buddies who also came to the teams. So what year was that? 1990 was with a guy that I went to Mepps with. Yeah. And he ended up in the teams, ended up a master chief, just a freaking awesome guy. We were like riding the Mepps buds down to the airport. And we're talking about, you know, he was a wrestler. And so we're talking about, I was like, you know, he, I think he said to me like, oh, you, you, you trying for, you trying for buds? And I was like, yeah, are you? And he said, yeah. And of course, there was, you know, a bunch of guys that were trying for buds, but, but anyways, he had been to college. Yep. And I was kind of like dumb. And, but he was telling me, hey, you know, the casualty rate of seals, I think it was him that told me this, the casualty rate of seals is like 50%. The chance of finishing a career at 20 years is like, it's almost nothing. And I was like, hell, yeah, like we're going to war. I think he must have read that. And if the, again, if I'm putting this on this guy, I'm sorry, but some, I heard that rumor in boot camp. I'm pretty sure with him that was like, hey, it's really hard to retire as a seal because chances are you're just going to get killed. Yeah. And I remember being fired up about that. I was like, hell, yeah. And then of course, I got to, you know, Seal Team one in 1991. And that's the first Gulf War. And yeah, realized pretty quick. I wasn't going to Vietnam. But yes, these guys that were coming in post 9-11. And especially once it was really obvious that this was going to be a long war. Like if you were enlisting in 2005, 2006, 2007. Yeah, you know what you're getting into. I remember Tim Kennedy saying that when he went to enlist on September 12, like there's a line around the building. I remember I called the officer detailer. And on September 12, you know, and I was in the Navy having a college at the time. And I was saying, hey, sir, you know, send me some of your team right now. Please, I'll congratulate later. And he says, you know, hey, it's going to be a long war. Don't worry. But I was actually talking to him a couple of years ago. And he said, I was like, yeah, I remember calling you. He said, everybody called me. And I was like, that's actually awesome. You know, that's exactly how you want it. Everybody in the teams wanted to go and fight. Did you do seeming to Admiral or yes? Okay. So I did my first eight years at Seal Team 1. And then I got picked up for the Seaman Admiral program. I was in the second class of Seaman Admiral program. And then went from Team 1 to OCS E5 at Team 1 OCS for 13 weeks and Senate Team 2. It was freaking awesome. Yeah. I didn't realize you're on these coasts. Yep. Yep. Went to Team 2. But that new guy experience that you had, I mean, I, you know, even though it's like, oh, there's nothing to nothing to like about it. But damn, it's freaking awesome being a new guy in the Seal. But doing well, it's super formative. It's super like foundational to where you go and what you become and how you succeed or don't succeed in the community. And I think back to some of the mentors and the guys who really developed me at that point, they're tremendous in your life. They are super influential, again, in this notion of where you end up and what you become and what choices you decide to make. So I had some guys that I really respected that helped develop me and bring me along. So were you like a point man? I'm guessing. Yeah. Yeah. Just like you'd guess you're a 60-unner. I was actually a radio man. Yeah. Yeah. That was, I signed up to be a radio man. I heard an officer told me on quarter deck watch. He said, if you want to, if you want to go on every mission, you should be a radio man. And I was like, probably the only guy in the history of Seal team one that walked up to the radio room the next day and knocked on the door and said, I want to be a radio man. Like no one ever wanted to be a radio man, except for me. So it was great advice though. So you end up a point man and then you're going on, these are peacetime deployments, you're training people, you're doing exercises and all this kind of thing. September 11th comes, how long did it take for you to go from peacetime deployments to wartime deployments? Much longer than I thought it would. I think when it first went down, we were all like, oh shit, here we go, it's real, we're going to go to war now. At that period, especially with the teams I was at, it wasn't every seal team didn't push out. And everyone, even within a year afterwards, it was very clear to get into combat that I had to make a few career choices, career decisions and basically put myself out online kind of to do that. That I had to take a different step. And so I did that and then I went to a team where okay, it's real, we're going to combat right away. And then did a few deployments, did multiple deployments and went through that phase. On that on 9-11, I remember I was in Montana and we were training on the Blackfoot reservation and we were working with the BIA, the Bureau of Indian Affairs. And we had gone to their facility and I'll never forget this, it's so crazy. A few days before 9-11, we're looking at the FBI top 10 list and I was just skimming in and I saw Ben Laden and it just stood out to me and I'm like, oh, look, some of Ben Laden's on the, and I knew of him from the coal bombing and that incident. And it's like that, I remember him and being on that FBI top 10 list standing out. And then a few mornings later, we were staying at a resort hotel. I remember walking into the lobby and everyone huddled around the TVs and that had just happened and seeing the planes hit the towers. And at that point, you know, it was still, I think pretty quickly though, within a week or two, they tied it to him. Maybe even within a few days, they tied it to Ben Laden. I don't remember, do you? I don't remember when it got tied in. I mean, I remember the second plane hitting and it was like, then it was real obvious. And I also remember hearing, because I was not drawn to the TV and I was going, I was actually going to college at the University of San Diego and I show up there and I'm kind of listening to radio and there's some little, something, you know, they're saying there's some news break. Oh, there's been a, a plane tip, World Trade Center. I don't, you know, I figure a SESNA. You know what I mean? Like, I just didn't, they didn't make it sound like what it was as big as it was. And so I'm going to class, I just turned off the radio, go to class. Like I thought it was just a SESNA hit the tower, I get done with class and I go to, I actually go train Jiu-Jitsu and when I get to Jiu-Jitsu, they're like, no one at Jiu-Jitsu watches TV. That's just like not happening. And I get to my Jiu-Jitsu Academy and everyone's watching TV and I'm like, what is going on? And sure enough, the second tower had been hit. And yeah, next thing, you know, I'm calling my detail or trying to figure out how I can get back to a SEAL team. Well, much later in the whole, in the conflicts, the more all teams you're getting involved, I think in that first, even that first call it three to five, six, period, or three, or I'm sorry, oh, one, two, maybe four or five. There was a small amount of guys going out, especially once Iraq popped up too. Then it's like all the teams were getting a lot of action. Yeah. So in 0, three, I went to Iraq and in 0, four, my whole team showed up. So I had one platoon in Iraq in 0, three. And then in 0, I was at team seven and then the whole team showed up. Yep. And it was like then that was it from then on the team's rotating. And that was like in the beginning when it was just Afghanistan, that definitely wasn't the case. Oh, yeah, definitely not. Yeah, definitely not because it was a rapid point. What period is this? So most of the battle romati that we talk about in that book is 2006, 2006 from April until October 2006. Okay. And so we were, we were, anyways, over there with guys, I don't even know, were you over there at that time? We were in a row six. I was back. I was not deployed. Yep. So you're, we kind of already talked about the fact that you were in Afghanistan doing missions and you're, you're feeling good on the patrol in, you're feeling okay on the patrol out, but maybe on target, you're feeling like maybe a little bit of the lightweight. Yeah, it's interesting. So I'm doing a lot of training right now with, we're working with General Donahue. He's a three-star in charge of 18th airborne core. 18th airborne core is hundreds of thousands. It's massive. And he's tasked us with, he wasn't charged with 82nd airborne before this post 82nd airborne. He's, he's tasked us to do CrossFit training with third infantry, third ID and Fort Stewart. So we're conducting some training with their soldiers out there. And where I'm tying this into or why brought that up is because same thing with here, trained, he said, he's like training for an athletic contest. And even you reference to, and you hear a lot of the strength and conditioning coaches, talk about how like our training should be more like athletes and professional athletes in general. It's actually fascinating because as I've thought about it, it's, athletes and professional athletes specifically, the demands of their sport and their job are so clearly defined. I think we need to have a mental reset where no, we need to train like combat warriors and we need to be proud of that. And we need to be proud that it's different than being professional athlete because what we're training for you have no idea what you're up against. And, and in this effort with the army hearing some of the other fitness specialists or fitness professionals and other soldiers talk about training like a professional athlete or training like an athlete, it's, it's actually the wrong perspective. You should train like the, the combat warrior or soldier that you are and be proud of that. And that is a very different demand and requires very different skill sets than the clearly defined. I mean, even you take a fighter where they have great conditioning and their great athletes, their pro athletes, some of them, they're, what they have to train for is in a box. They understand three minute rounds or five minute rounds, one minute rest. And within that, they have to be incredibly capable, obviously, but they don't need to train for five hours or they don't need to train for 48 hours out there. The demands of a soldier, the demands of a warrior are everything and anything. Yep, it could be everything from 13 kilometer patrol. One day, rest for the day, another 10 kilometers the next night, you get on a target somewhere, then you've got to kick open a door, then you've got to haul something, then you got to grapple with someone. Yeah. Then you got to lift that person into a, like there's, there's such a unlimited variation that you can come up against that you really do have to train and prepare for that. Even though it's funny, I was, I have one of my training partners, Guy name Meehaw. He's a, you know, really good Gigi Tu Blackbelt. And for, I've been training with him for the last six months or so. And we have been training the entire time with five minute rounds. That's just like our standard, you know, you get to want to roll with a bunch of different people. So we do the five minute rounds and all good. And we went on a trip. We went on a trip and all of a sudden it's just me and him and we were doing no time limit rounds, just like we're training to submission. And he mentioned it. You know, he got done. He's like, it's a lot different. When we're going with no time limit. And I was like, I hadn't really thought about it, but I was like, Oh, yeah, there's a lot of, you know, all of a sudden, it's not the explosiveness is down, the endurance is up. Like it's a different strategy. It's different tactics and it's different even from a physical conditioning perspective. So then you take, that's just one element of combat. Now you take that and multiply it times the infinite different things that you can face. And, and you realize, man, you got to, you got to condition yourself. Like you said, it's not, it's not a sport. Yeah, no, sport has rules. Yeah. Then there's got to be a mentality change and shift and a lot of leaderships and soldiers who kind of say that because it's easy to default to that. And it's easy to think, oh, we need this, this guy who taught the Dallas Cowboys or the strength conditioning coach from there. Like, yeah, those guys are well educated. They've trained professional athletes, but that doesn't translate necessarily to working with warriors. And that's something very special. I want to ask you this about striking because you brought it up in general or fighting, I should say. I'm a big believer that if I were to start someone from scratch now at this point to prepare for physical combat, I think striking is a good start to keep people away. And then actually before you did, Sue, I think learning judo and the skills of judo, trying to get people off and keep them away with, but prior to going to the ground actually creates a well-rounded, capable fighter. What do you guys think about that? Yeah, I heard some quote recently and I actually covered on the podcast. I can't remember exactly what it was, but it was something along the lines of, if I have two hours to prepare you, yep, we're not even going to talk about grappling. Yeah. If I have two weeks to prepare you, I'm going to start to address it. If I have two years to prepare you, that's where I'm going to start. Okay. Because it does take a lot longer to learn. And you know, I always recommend if you're going to commit to something and you're going to train, you should start with juditsu. The reason is because if you're, if we're in a striking combat, if we're in a fight and you boxed and I didn't, I can run away from you. Yeah. If you want to kick me in your kickboxer, I can run away from you. I don't have to actually fight you until you grab a hold of me. And then my kicking doesn't work. My punching doesn't work. What works is grappling, what works is juditsu. And if you wrestled and I didn't wrestle, you're going to take me down. Like, to this day, like I didn't wrestle in high school. Yeah. If somebody wrestled in high school, they're going to take me down. Yeah. Does what's going to happen? Like you, they spent four years. Yeah. You know, it's kind of like the swimming thing. Yeah, it's kind of like the swimming thing. So they're going to get the takedown. So what I have to get good at is I have to get good at juditsu. I have to get good at, from a self-defense perspective, getting back off the ground, getting away from them, breaking contact. So that's what that's how I would answer that question. Uh, judo's great. judo's great. The throws in judo are great. They rely on the takedowns in wrestling. Comprehensively are more reliable. But if it's pure self-defense and you know a good judo throw, man, that's really good. Peabee, you're dealing with somebody that's got clothes on. You can grab a hold of their clothes. There's no grabbing clothes in wrestling. That means also, if I have to grab clothes and the clothes aren't there, my, my moves don't work if I'm a wrestler, if I'm a judo player. So being well-rounded, it almost goes back to the same theory of fitness, which is being well-rounded and having an open mind and being decent at a lot of different things is probably going to be better than being an expert in one thing. And that was really proven out in the early UFC's, which is this guy that's a pure boxer is losing to, you know, hoist-gracy. This guy that's a pure taekwondo is losing to a wrestler. You would see that these purists, and then the pure wrestler is losing to the juditsu guy. The juditsu guy was the most rounded at the time. Yep. And if you take just pure one sport or one technique or one art versus one other art, juditsu clearly was the winner. That's, that's been proven. So that being said, nowadays, you have to learn everything. Yeah. And you want to learn everything. So, you know, when, when we were dealing with combatives and the SEAL teams, one of the arguments that got, I got told about certain systems was, hey, you know, juditsu takes too long to learn. MMA takes too long to learn. We only can train these guys for five days or seven days or two weeks. So we have to give them something that's going to help immediately. And I said, hey, how long have you been in the teams for? Nine years, 12 years, seven years. I go, hey, man, you don't have two weeks to learn how to fight. And you can't learn how to fight in two weeks. You have a career to learn how to fight. So, learn how to fight. And then you'll be much, much better off. And to some degree, combatives and the fight in general, there's obviously a lot of skill that comes with it. But there's a warrior mindset and like a perspective that this guy in front of me is not going to stop me. And I'm going to fucking go through him or do whatever it takes. And it might not express in perfect technique in the perfect form, but there's an aggression that I saw that I think sometimes even trumps a lot of the traditional training. You think it's some of the guys that we fucking worked with, guys bigger than you, guys as big as you that weren't as well trained as you and combatives was still beast and still able to muster up the fight and the aggression to take anyone out. Yeah, no, there's there's a level of just being aggressive that is going to be very, very helpful in a combat situation, especially with a lot of the people we would come across, meaning probably not trained. Exactly. Yeah, like it's, you come up against a 160 pound, you know, 43 year old Iraqi dude, like you're 227 pounds. Freak and seal that can bench 380 like and his, and he's hostile. Dude, he's going to bring it that dude that that Iraqi doesn't he's not going to cause much of a problem. Now that being said, I saw with my own eyes guys getting guys having problems controlling Iraqis. I saw that with my own eyes. I mean, one of the very first like times I was out in Iraq, 2003, and we were doing a vehicle introduction and we we get this vehicle pulled over and I'm the ground force commander. So I'm kind of like, you know, got my gun high port. I'm kind of observing the whole situation, making sure everything's cool and all of a sudden I hear this guy calling for help like a seal. And I'm like, this is weird. So I walk over and sure enough he's in, he's in hand-to-hand combat with like a 15 year old kid and he's not winning. And so I go over and it takes me two seconds to get the guy under control and get get it solved. But he was panicked. The 15 year old kid was panicked. He doesn't know what the hell's going on. So he's freaking out. He's, do you get that pain like we used to hear pain compliance? Pain compliance also causes pain non-compliance because if you start torquing on my wrist or torquing on my shoulder, I get, I react to it and my reaction might seem like hostility to you. So then you apply more pressure. That makes me fight even harder. And next thing you know, we've escalated the situation. Yeah. One of the good things about training combatives all the time, jujitsu boxy moitai wrestling, all that stuff is that you are very used to physical confrontation. It happens to me every single day. Like an hour before you got here, I had a bunch of savage dudes trying to choke me, right? Grab in my neck, grab in my arm, trying to knock me down to the ground. But that's what I do every day. And when you get used to that, it just becomes very, very natural. Much like you already pointed out the example of someone that swims like this dude, no fence. And that guy passed pool comp easily and he's not freaking out. You take some kid from Iowa that didn't spend much time in the water. They get in the water. They freak out. Yep. So doing this stuff regularly is extremely important. You know, that's another thing with like parachuting, right? I would use the comparison. Like who does better? Well, if you're getting, if you get into sport parachuting, right? You get really good at sport parachuting. And then guess what? When you put on a rock and a weapon, it's not like, oh, now you're all confused because you got a rock and a weapon on. No, those people that are sky gods and have 6,000 civilian jumps, they have 6,000 civilian jumps, you can put anything on them. And they know how to handle it, they make it happen. It's not like they go, oh, no. Same thing with, well, same thing with sport parachuting. Oh, I'm saying. You know what? So since I got out of the teams, I became an average shooter and I shoot in a lot of different disciplines and that's my passion now. So I spent a lot of my off time competing in shooting sports. And in the teams, when I was, at least when I was coming up and especially on the East Coast, there was no culture for pursuing the shooting sports outside of being a team guy and the training that we did. The army guys, some of the army guys I saw, they actually had a pretty good culture of competing outside of work in some of these civilian competitions. And to this day, they still do. I've actually recently worked with guys from one and a few other teams down here in trying to help them expose them more to the civilian competition world because if you're shooting civilian competitions, you are way better than everyone else who's shooting just in the teams. And I think that our operators aren't fighting enough. Like you said, they're not making that a premium and they're not shooting enough. And those two things pursuing it, but it's also like it's so easy to say from the outside, but it's also like our time is so precious and asking someone to shoot on the weekend. You know, they're taken away from an already really, or taking their time away from their family with an already really busy schedule. But because when I first got out, I mean, I accomplished a lot in the military. I worked with some of the best units. I was a good shooter. And then I went and shot some civilian competitions. And I failed. I mean, I finished like at the very bottom. And I saw how slow I was. So my eyes were opened. And I'm a huge believer. It's just like the sport parachuting aspect. Like you pursue that stuff a little bit on the side and you're going to make yourself a much better warrior and prepare for combat. Yeah. Like you were a lead climber. Yeah. Exactly. So you're a lead climber when you're out climbing a LCAP. Are you wearing all your gear for combat? No. But when you're now in combat and you got your gear on and you have to figure out some kind of a problem, you're going to be infinitely better. And some people used to say we're going to get bad habits. Do you remember that? That was one of the things you're going to get bad habits. You're going to get bad habits. And I was like, man, if you're that good at civilian shooting, yeah, those bad habits that you have are just going to be nothing. They're going to be they're they're going to be good. I think we I know actually it's interesting. I think you learned skills to apply to different scenarios, meaning what we can be called a bad habit. While in the sport, let's say you're you're drawing from the side and you're engaging and then you're clustering without sweeping right. And that would be considered a bad habit. When you get to the environment or the training environment with the seal teams where you have to us look left and right, you'll know to do that. Yeah. Like you're smart enough and trained enough to adapt to different situations with different skill sets from the same realm. Yeah. Meaning there's a lot of different techniques. It's like it's like well to go back to the climbing stuff too. For ascending a rope, there's people would say, okay, so you use this Prusikknot and then you tie here and you create the system and you ascend a line. And I would I would I learned early on don't learn the not learn the system learn. Okay, you need a friction knot here. Not necessarily a Prusikk. There's probably five different friction knots you can apply to this scenario. So even to these days and the same probably same with Jiu Jitsu. There's a lot of different ways to tackle a single problem. Obviously in the beginning, it might make sense to teach one, but then you have to educate conceptually. I need to build a toolbox in leadership too. Same sort of principle. And so this is sort of the attitude that opened your mind to CrossFit. Absolutely. And for me, again, I was watching an old clip that we recorded on this podcast a long time about CrossFit. Somebody asked me like, what do you think of CrossFit? And I actually compared oddly enough, I actually compared CrossFit with the Gracie family. Because if the Gracie family didn't exist, we would not have the UFC. We would not have mixed martial arts. We would not have this incredible progress and open-mindedness that has now become the core belief inside of mixed martial arts. Anyone that's a mixed martial artist right now, which pretty much if you train martial arts now, you're a mixed martial artist. Your premise is there's going to be new things that work. There's going to be some things that don't work. If something works, it's good. If it doesn't work, it's bad. If it doesn't work, we don't throw it away. But we definitely are going to consider what the benefits are and when is the appropriate time for it. But the key component being my mind is open to what is happening. I looked at CrossFit. Now, I was an odd person that had always kind of been into strong man Olympic lifting. I never had an Olympic lifting coach. I wish I would have. They didn't exist. There's a magazine called Milo. I was a subscriber from Milo from 1994. I think is when I have my first copies. I still have them. In there, they had Olympic lifting. They had strong man. They had power lifting. They had those things in there. I knew about them. But I, like me doing a clean-in jerk, was an embarrassment to the world of technique. But I knew about it. I knew about it. There wasn't a place to learn clean-in jerk in San Diego. There wasn't a limp. There wasn't bumper plates in San Diego. There wasn't bumper plates at the seal teams. So CrossFit came in. And actually, I remember, the reason I asked you the date when you were researching it, you were researching about it. So I was on deployment in 2003. And remember, I said the whole team showed up, including my commanding officer. And I pretty sure he's the guy that said to me, hey, have you heard of this stuff? And I was like, no, and I started looking at it. And I said to him, hey, news flash. If you pick up heavy stuff and you do it over and over again, you're going to get stronger and you're going to get better shape. I acted like this was common sense. And it was a little bit of common sense to me, but I don't want to give myself too much credit. I'm not trying to say, I'm definitely not trying to say, I had that. But like, like, but let me say one piece you're not saying, but you understood inherently. And what's one of the reasons why CrossFit is so effective is the intensity aspect of it. 100% and picking up heavy shit under intensity and intensity in CrossFit translates to the things being timed. Sorry to interrupt, but I just wanted to say this. Interestingly enough, nowadays, especially with even some spec operators or some pro athletes, intensity is incredibly vulnerable. Intensity, you see it in fighting. I mean, you have to be, if you don't have intensity, you're going to get choked out. But in training, people are now doing the movements, but taking the intensity out because they don't want to be exposed. They don't want to be seen training under duress or not coming out screaming, making shaking and you can't scream anymore. That's when you're really there as long as no more noise to be made. You got nothing left. So the intensity piece too is what you were talking about in the very beginning. Yep. Yeah. And that so CrossFit comes in. So when did you, so it was 2003, 2004, that's when you actually started doing it? So probably four, five, I was doing it. And then in six or seven, six, I was in Monterey and started working out with, or I knew CrossFit was based out of Santa Cruz. And so I started going over there, met Glassman, started introducing myself to him and just started training with them. And that's going to school in Monterey. Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah. And so that's how I, that's how I always connected to Glassman. He'd always been super welcoming of military guys, especially at that time. And so he found out I was in the Navy. Let me train there for free, started inviting me to events, started. Was this the actual Santa Cruz? Yes. Yep. That actual original gym started offered me a spot at a level one seminar. I went to the level one seminar with a few other seals. Then he asked for me to attend someone help out. And so I started going to them and helping out as an instructor. And what's interesting at this point, so this is six seven, there were a handful of other team guys that were from West Coast that were in that same Glassman circle, kind of working with him and part of his little crew, I'll say. And this is 06, 07. Yeah. And so 06 for sure. And I, so my, I'm pretty sure my assistant platoon commander, who was with me, when my CEO said like, Hey, what do you think of this stuff? And I was like, Hey, lift stuff, go hard. You're going to get better shape. Like he was my workout buddy. We were doing all kinds of stuff. Like he was doing the 20 rep squats with be like, we get, he's a freaking, you know, a badass athlete. And we were, we were getting after it. And then when we got back, he, I think he went to Buds as an instructor. And so that's why he had time to go and start to get engaged with CrossFit. Well, we ended up having lunch, maybe in eight or nine with Glassman and Nicole Carroll. Okay. So we had lunch at Coronado Brewing Company. Okay. And I think that's the first time I met you. And I'd known of you. I was still an instructor at that point. And yeah, the four of us sat down. I remember that lunch for some reason. I don't remember what we talked about, but we hung out. Yeah. Yep. And that's why, so I was going to ask you this. So I went to a level one certification for the teams. Yep. I think it might have been the first one that you guys put on. It was pre-me for sure. Okay. So I was, Greg, they were doing seminars before I was coming around. Got it. Yeah. So they were doing those level ones before I was coming around. And then I got involved. And what's interesting in that, the life lesson and the thing I talked to people about from my experience in my engagement with CrossFit at that stage, I had accomplished a lot in the military. I had done a full spectrum of things. I was at the top of the tip of the spear, call it, for who we were. And here I was kind of introduced to a new community, introduced to a new, almost opportunity job opportunity. And there was a couple of different paths to go. One was sitting there and being like, well, I'm a seal. I've done this. I'm good. Just like ramp me up to the front of the line. And or just fucking buckling down and getting to work. And I took this perspective of everything I, everything, and I tell guys this now, everything you did in the past is significant. And it's foundational. And it's, it's, it's, it's very, it's why you are who you are. And it's taking you to multiple levels. But once, and it'll open a lot of doors for you. But once those doors are opened, you have got to start over. You've got to prove value and show who you are, care and now and stop leaning on the past. Stop living in the past. And so that's kind of was my, my way of operating when I first got involved in CrossFit. I was fucking taking the trash out. And I was setting up chairs. And here I was. I'd been in the Navy for nine, ten years at that point. And again, accomplished an immense amount of things where I could be proud of everything and not, not take trash out ever again or not set up chairs. But I started from the bottom and just went in with like, okay, I'm the new guy. I'm a new guy again. And that attitude was really for me in getting through and it call it advancing and getting more opportunities with CrossFit was significant. And it was very powerful. And, and it's something that I like to tell guys, hey, man, don't just be super humble. Regardless of what you've done in the past. Two things. Number one, my first seminar. I feel like I kind of knew what was up a little bit. I was heads up. So it kind of was talking to me like, hey, no, I remember had the old school PVC homemade rings. And he goes, he's like, oh, you got to try and muscle up. And I was like, what is it? He goes, I was like this. And I, and I remember thinking to myself, I got to do this right. Like it's just me and him or hanging out. And the first try got it. I was like, oh, totally bad technique. But what I realized was like, oh, there's, there's things going on here. So I remember I was at that that level one. Was it in Ramona? No, it's at the team. Okay. Oh, okay. They did one for you there. Yep. Yep. So what year? I don't know. Okay. It's around this time frame. It's around when I might have been involved with that one. Yeah. It might have been, it seems like maybe that's why we were at lunch. Yeah. Cause we might have been, cause we did a few seminars at the teams there. Yeah. By the time I was coming around. Yep. So I remember thinking this is a trick. Not, not in a bad way. But I remember at the first UFC was 1993, I already knew Jiu Jitsu. I knew Hoy's Grace who was going to win that thing. They start saying like, hey, who wants to do, you know, whatever? Who wants to, who thinks they can lift 95 pounds? It's like, I see a couple of team guys raising their hand. I'm like, this is a setup, dude. You're getting set up. Who wants to go against the cold with this? And I'm like, dude, you guys are getting set up. You guys are, you guys are getting smoked. You're going to get crushed right now. So I kind of knew what was up. I need to keep my freaking mouth shut. Because if you don't train in those modalities, you're going to be, you're going to get caught totally off guard. And a lot of the movements, especially the ones they put guys up against Nicole, specifically the overhead squat, the flexibility, demand, they're not there for a lot of guys, unless you've been training like this, unless you're Olympicweight lifting and or cross fitting, your shoulder mobility probably isn't there to have the bar in a optimal position to do high reps to do a 27 reps. Exactly. And why are you face to face with Nicole? Yeah, right? Exactly. Which is what you're getting yourself into. Yep. And this was, it got honestly, it was like, it was like the first UFC because people just didn't know. People just didn't know. And they were like, Oh, I got the up and squat 380. What? This girl's going to beat me? No way. Give me that 95 pounds. Are you kidding me? And I was like, this is so you're about to get choked out, choked out physically in the physical realm. But, but what, what an eye opener, right? What an eye opener to say, Oh, there's a little bit of a dip. There's more to this than just how much can you squat? You know, what's your shoulder mobility, what's your hip mobility, what's your ankle mobility, where are you at? And do you have it? And by the way, if you can't do that, what else can't you do? Where else are you falling short? And muscle up is another great example. Like, isn't it a very important skill to be able to take yourself, your body weight and pull yourself up, not just up to the bar, but above the bar. Yep. That seems like it doesn't take a genius to go, that seems like it might be a really good skill to have. I should be able to do that. And there's some technique to it. And there's some strength to it. There's some flexibility to it. And I don't have those things and I better figure them out right now because I'll tell you what, I did that one. Well, the first time I ever did a muscle up, I did one. Thank God. I didn't get asked to do another one because who knows what would happen. I prove. So that's what I saw. So as you go up to Santa Cruz and you're just getting annihilated and workouts, you know, and you're just thinking, what is going on? Well, they got me actually with Nicole early on. One of my first sessions ever, yeah, they got me. They got me one of my first sessions ever at the CrossFit Santa Cruz. I went to an evening class and they get us in a big circle and they're warming us up and they warmed us up for the push jerk. And I didn't have, I had been doing CrossFit now for probably eight or nine months, but I didn't never coached. And so I didn't still doing a lot of these movements poorly. And they're like, all right, now we're going to break up into groups and we're going to do this for, I think it was a one rep max load. And so they had four platforms out in the gym. It's a small gym. And they go, okay, this, this platform is going to have the ladies, they're going to gravitate towards that group. This platform is going to have the stronger ladies of the class. This platform is going to have the men, this platform is going to have the stronger men. And I go, okay, cool, I start walking over the stronger men platform. And the guy goes, no, no, you're going to go to this fifth platform that was, no one was at yet. And I was like, I don't just think I should lift up the dudes and they're like, no, no, go to this platform. And then I see, and then I see this 130 pound year old female putting a bar on there and she's like tiny. And I go, hey, man, I don't know about this. I shouldn't be lifting with the female. I should be lifting with the guys and trainers like, no, no, no, I'll lift with her. I'm like, all right, maybe they just want, you know, her to have someone to show her how it's done. And so we start, barbell warm up a couple reps. The 25s go on, do some at 95. Then the 35, 45s go on, we're 135. I look around and like all of the other groups, the men, one group of men are at 145. The others not, the women are not even close to that. And we're knocking out one, some reps at 135. And then she's adding more weight and more weight. And her form is impeccable the entire time. We get to 165, 175. And again, that's not a lot, but I wasn't, I'm not a big guy. And at that time, I was new to these movements. I hit whatever 175. And I'm like, that was tough. And then she gets it no problem. And I'm like, oh, I'm like, this was a fucking setup. And then we go to 185. And I miss it. And she gets under it and nails it. And we didn't talk to each other a single moment. It was a Nicole. Yeah, this was the same as the one they set up shut down. Yeah. And she crushed me. And I left that gym calling guys back on the East Coast saying, I fucking should turn in my trident. I just got destroyed by a, by a female on a barbell movement. But that's cross it. And just like jujitsu, just like jujitsu. There's people they get choked out by the 150 pound girl. And they never come back. And their ego is so destroyed that they think, oh, this is a, if this was a real fight, I would have done this. And you think, you know, wolf, this was a real situation. I'll just pick up and throw her to the ground. Instead of going, damn, I got some weaknesses. I need a war wound. And that's the difference. It's a very, it's a humbling experience. Just like jujitsu is a humbling experience. Crossfit is a very humbling experience. And you'll see people doing movements that they've, that they've trained in. Yeah. That's why the, it's also similar to jujitsu is like, oh, the reason 150 pound woman choked you out isn't because she's a better human being than you. It's because she's trained for that. The reason that Nicole beats you in clean impress or whatever it was movement you were doing isn't because she's a better human being than you. It's because she's trained in it. Well, you know, to that same, no, I would hear guys talking about the shooting stuff again. Like, like, we'd hire external experts, shooting experts to work with us. And like, oh, those guys shoot all the time. That's why they're good. Exactly. But like, yeah, like, that's not an insult. Like, but people would say it as an insult. Like, he shoots all the time. So he's really good. Well, yes, you guys roll all the time. So you're really good. That's part of being really good. I tapped a guy out one time. Who is a team guy? And I was bigger than him. And stronger than him. And I tapped him out. And he goes, you never would have got that if you weren't so strong. And I said, that's why I lift him out of the fucker. I also wanted to say this. Like, you said it a while ago, you were talking about the fact that we don't shoot enough. They shoot a lot more now in the teams. They're doing way better. And they, and they do more combatives way more. It across the board, they're just going to be better. They're going to be better seals than we were because they're just, they got it. They got it on tap. The shooting and the fitness, um, less so with the combatives, but you might, you might argue with this or you might have an answer that I'm not thinking of, but it needs to be measured. And what I mean by the standards, like shooting, there needs to be time and everything. If you're, unless, and same with fitness, unless you're putting it out there and competing and actually, okay, what's your draw from a holster with retention? If you guys are just going through the motions and not actually measuring it and pushing it and trying to get faster, it's still great, right? Don't get me wrong. But that's the thing that takes it to the next level. Same thing with CrossFit, the fitness guys and the fittest people are doing it under a stopwatch. And actually, there's a ceiling for intensity that we're all capable of. And they're actually training there and pushing it and hitting on that ceiling. And you keep hitting it and you raise it. If you don't train with intensity and hit that ceiling at all, you're never going to raise that ceiling. So the question then from that is back to the combative part, how do you measure and how do you, you do what the US Army does? We have a massive combative tournament. You have combative tournaments on basis. You have people trained and you can make it like, hey, you will compete in this and that way you know who's training and who's not training. And I think that's a great way that they do that to get people to train because if you're training, you're going to know if you're not training, you're going to get crushed. So it's very cool. The way the army sets that up, I don't know if the Marine Corps has those on the one looking at you Echo, but I don't know if the Marine Corps has those combative tournaments the way the army does. The Army has legit. And then you advance through that system so you get like belts in their system. What do you think of that? I'm happy that people are training. I'm overjoyed that people are training. If you take a Marine that knows McMap compared to a Marine that doesn't, that Marine that knows McMap is going to win 10, 10, 10, nine times out of 10, if not 99 times out of 100. So I'm glad that they're training. And look, belts to me and that kind of stuff. I've never really, I've never really been that super into them. I know why little kids, why it's cool, little kids like belts, you know, little kids want to get stripes on their belts and they want to get that next color belt. I get it. And adults too, you know, there's some adults that they get some some goal accomplishment, right? Which is fine. So I think if it helps people train, good. But that's easy coming from the Super Black Belt over here. Easy for him to say at this point. I can say I never, even when I wasn't a black belt, how long did it take you to get the black belt? 10 years. Damn. Yeah. Hey, I respect the shit out of GJC and their path towards excellence and how they give them way they give belts and I give away how you earn a belt because it takes a tremendous amount of effort and commitment. And and I especially in the traditional martial arts, that's not there. I mean, you get people getting belts in Taekwondo in a few years. When they're nine. Yeah, exactly. Which is, which is unfortunate. At this point, so when did you actually leave the Navy? What year was that? Oh nine. And so I had been working for CrossFit for about three years at that point and I had an instructor at Buds and that's where I had to make were you a Buds instructor or SKT instructor? SKT. Okay. Yeah, but it was under bloods at that time. That's why I say that. I had to make a decision and stay in. Again, if I was going to stay in, I was going to end up going back to being operational and I wouldn't have been able to do the work. I was doing for CrossFit or get out and work full time for CrossFit and you got to understand at that point, you know, a nine CrossFit was already like blowing up. Like the games had been around for three years. Our number of seminars were exploding. The number of affiliates were exploding. I was already becoming like a figure in the community. And so and honestly, financially, I was able to take care of my family much better if I pursued the CrossFit route and didn't do the Navy thing. So it was a tough decision. And I will say this about the time. Saying I don't talk a lot about stuff, I will acknowledge this story. Shortly before getting out, I called one of my old team leaders from the East Coast. And I said, Hey, are you guys pumping out anytime soon? And he said, Yeah, we are. I'm like, I want to come with you. And so I asked the leadership. I'm like, Hey, can I go on a little deployment? They said, Yep. And so I hadn't signaled to the Navy or anyone at this point that I was getting out. But a few months before I got out, I was fortunate enough to push over with my old group and do a last deployment to Afghanistan. That was pretty fucking cool. And it was unique because, and this is a unique piece that really nobody knows. I was overseas planning the CrossFit games and planning seminars for CrossFit from Afghanistan, from internet. We had hijacked from some local brits. And so then I came and it was honestly, again, I couldn't signal or tell anyone I was doing that because they probably would have not let me, they wouldn't have let me do that. But I came back and was like, Okay, now I'm done. Like I have it out of my system. You got out of your system. Yeah. And I needed that one last touch point to know I could walk away from it. Now, 10 years later, no 14 years later, I made the right decision. But sometimes I'm like, man, I wish I would have stayed in. And especially as the years have passed, I really like appreciated what I did and who I worked with and wish I would have done it longer. But the outcome would have never, that was the right choice at the right time. I actually say, glassmen saved my life because I do think, especially, you know, the deal, doing the stuff we do and the number of times you go overseas, it's ultimately becomes a numbers game. And so by giving me the opportunity to get out and do this, I feel like I do say that honestly, like he saved my life. But I loved it. And I miss it. And again, as time has gone on, I really wish I would have stayed in longer. When I got fired a year and a half ago, two years ago, whenever it was, when I got fired at the first thing I did is I texted one of my buddies on the East Coast and said, Hey, you guys need a shooter. And he thought I was joking. I was actually kind of serious. But, uh, yeah. So timing wise, I was looking at the history, um, 2000, the year 2000 CrossFit was, was incorporated in 2001, the first gym opened. In 2005, there was 13 CrossFit gyms. Yeah, nuts. Victory, which is my gym, we started our CrossFit affiliate in 2007. I want to find out what number we are. Oh, we can find that out for sure. Yeah. I mean, that's pretty good to go. And then there was top, probably top two or three hundred for sure. It might have been. And again, this is like for probably right after we're doing these things. Yeah. It was late 2007 because we opened our doors open here, January 2nd, 2008. But we had everything maybe, yeah, by 2013, there's 8,000 gyms. There's over 10,000 gyms right now. So, so in 2009, this thing is blowing up. CrossFit's totally blowing up. Um, you decide to get out. And you're, you, what was your job? Well, at that point, I was running the seminar department, the training department actually with Nicole Carroll. And I was running the CrossFit Games. So I had created the CrossFit Games. The first three games, seven, eight, and nine were on the family ranch that I grew up on, the CrossFit Ranch. And they, um, after that, we ended up 2010. We had to move them out because the county kicked us out. But so I was in charge of the games and, um, in charge of the seminar department. Two of the, there was three large sectors or departments at the time of CrossFit. It was training, um, affiliates, and then the games. And so two of the three, I was in charge of which, and again, that's a super unique opportunity. And, and especially both of them, it's kind of like, I just, um, a lot of the hard work I put in and a lot of, I laid the foundation to do that. I laid the foundation worked hard and kind of, I don't want to say, um, well, again, I think I mentioned this earlier. Being a seal, though, I acknowledge and respect opened the door and opened the opportunity to be close to the leadership crew there. And then once that happened, I had to capitalize on it. Yeah. And essentially did. Yeah, you know, that's something that I, when we were talking about this earlier, the, the being a seal, people, people respect that. Yep. And they say, oh, you were a seal. That means you're a hard worker. That means you're disciplined. That means you've been in pressure situations. I would more, I'm, come, come work for me. Yep. So that door was open. Now, all those things that I just said about being a seal have various varying degrees of being true. Right? You might not necessarily be a hard worker. You might not necessarily be disciplined. You might be a terrible leader. There's terrible leaders in the seal teams. There's people that have terrible judgment and they were seals. So the door, there's a lot of doors that absolutely get opened up. But once you get inside, you, you're going to have to prove yourself. And that goes back to what you said earlier, just being humble and working hard and keeping an open mind is going to be the way to be successful. If you think you can ride being a seal, what is it on the movie elf? The Santa Claus meter? You know, not tracking me over here? No. The spirit meter. The spirit meter for being a seal only lasts so long. I mean, it burns out and people like, hey, you actually have a job to do. Are you going to be able to do this? And if you can't, you're not going to go very far. You obviously proved yourself. You're working hard. You end up running these two big portions of it and CrossFit starts to go rickter. Now, with popularity comes heat seeking missiles from all directions. And so CrossFit was the target of a lot of criticism. Like early on and right away. And what's crazy about that, people ask me like how I deal with some of the stuff now at this point, some of the public stuff. And I'm like, man, I've been dealing with this for over 15 years. And like early eight, nine time frame, like, you're already seeing personal, I'm already seeing personal attacks. I'm already seeing people online, trashing and destroying CrossFit, trashing and destroying me. And then as it just got larger, that just scaled on. So it just scaled. You know, I find that a lot of times when people are being critical of things, my general attitude is to say, they're probably right about something here. Like if somebody says that I like am doing something that doesn't seem to make sense, my initial reaction isn't, no, they're wrong. My initial reaction, okay, well, what am I doing? That's not making sense. And it seems like that attitude is a good attitude to have as opposed to getting super defensive and saying, no, I'm actually perfect. And why are you questioning everything that I do? Do people come at you at all? They're all afraid of you. It's not thing. No, I think it's because I would say I'm more, I think because I am open-minded about things that I'm not probably not the funnest target to attack. You know, if you say, I'm not a great seal, I'd be like, yeah, I definitely wish I was a better seal. If you say I'm not that good at Jiu-Jitsu, I would say, yeah, I definitely am not that good at Jiu-Jitsu. If you say I'm not that strong, I would say I'm certainly not that strong. If you say I'm not that smart, I'd say, you're right, I wish I was smarter. So it's probably not that fun to come at me because I don't, you're probably right. If you're finding fault with me, I'm going to say you're, in fact, you are right. So when people have negative things to say about me, they're probably, they are correct. And I nod my head and think about how I can get better. And I think that, you know, is a positive thing to do. And it helps to not feel, you know, like you're being ripped apart when I just feel like I'm getting good constructive criticism from the world sometimes, which is okay. And I think, you know, some of the criticisms across it along the way, I've been like, yeah, if you parse that out, I agree. So if someone's like, hey, you can get hurt if you don't learn to do Olympic lifts well. And then you do them while you're very fatigued, you can get hurt. Yeah, absolutely. That's correct. You know, if you learn to do them correctly, and you, you know, a huge part of this is just like Jiu-Jitsu. If your ego is driving you, look, if your ego is driving you, okay, cool. Your ego should, should make you not want to tap out in Jiu-Jitsu. Your ego should want to get two more reps. Your ego should want to, you know, beat the time. But just like in the SEAL teams, your ego should say, hey, I want Arplatoon to be the best. I want to win this shooting drill. But if your ego starts driving you to a point where you're making bad decisions, now it becomes a problem. Just like if your ego, you, you know, you get your arm broken or your shoulder torn apart because you didn't tap in Jiu-Jitsu, that's not beneficial. If your ego won't say, you know what? My form is falling apart right now. And I need to scale this weight. You're going to get hurt. If your ego is, you know, saying, oh, you know, I'm competing against Dave on the pistol right now. And I can see that his, he could do this, he could make this movement a little smoother on his, on his holster. But I'm not going to tell him. So now I'm hurting my team so I can win. Like, those are terrible things. So I think as I see and as I saw, because I, again, I mean, we've had a CrossFit affiliate here since 2007. As I saw those criticisms, I'd say, yes, that's correct. Here's what we need to do to watch out for that. Oh, the whole idea, again, this is one of the things just like Gracie Jiu-Jitsu brought a lot of things to martial arts, the ideal of scalable workouts. I never heard of that. We didn't hear about that in the SEAL teams. I never heard about it. Look, hey, if you're going to deadlift and you couldn't deadlift as much to me, sure, you're going to deadlift last week, but it wasn't a thing. It wasn't a thing. So to say, oh, yeah, if you think you're going to go and you're going to clean in Jerk 135 30 times for time and that's 70% of your max clean in Jerk, you're not being smart. Yeah. And you need to put your ego in check. Most new people should not do 30 clean in Jerks at 135 four times, but could they do 30 clean in Jerks with an empty PVC pipe, picking up a stick, bringing it to their shoulder and going overhead, probably and completely safely. And so, definitely the scaling aspect and what people forget about a lot in the criticism of the the danger of CrossFit, our core charter, we talk about in our course is mechanics, consistency, and then intensity. And with mechanics, it's about learning how to do the movement, learn how to do it correctly. And that journey probably isn't a 15-minute session at your first session. That journey can be a couple of months. Mechanic, consistent, do it well, do it well over and over. And then after your mechanics are consistently well, good, then you can add intensity and then you go for time. But that's been our charter from Greg wrote that, scripted that early on. And that's what we teach often ignored and often ignored in the expression of it. What I mean by that is like sometimes trainers get people and it's easy just to like go and like here. But we've got to really, it's so effective because it's so complex. And what I mean by that, these movements, these complex movements, there's a lot of bang for your buck and there's a lot of respect that needs to come with that. And they need to, you need to give them the intention that they deserve with training and education on how to do them prior to adding the intensity piece. Because, yeah, intensity and poor technique, intensity being going fast and high reps, for example, our recipe for disaster. On the 30 clean and jerks at 135, the opposite end of the spectrum. Now there's guys that'll do 30 clean and jerks at 225. So, so, so, unheard of, like you're seeing the progression and the whole full spectrum of it. And you know, we, the same thing, there was a lot of criticism around like, rap dough. And you can get rap dough. I don't know if I've ever had it. I don't actually think I've ever had it. I have not either. I, I think, you know, again, the probably, in my opinion, one of the primary causes of rap dough would be ego. Because if I'm trying to hang with you and I haven't worked out for the last four months or six months or maybe two years and you're doing a, you're doing a heavy fran. And I'm what I can actually do it. You know, because I still have some muscle memory. And so now I push myself so hard. I'm not conditioned for it. And that's when we end up with issues. Again, ego and look as, as instructor cadre, you got to watch out for that stuff for all these things. You know, the instructor cadre is responsible for saying it, putting egos in check. Yes. You know, for saying, hey, you know, we have to do this in jujitsu. I remember this is with kids training kids. I would be very, I would always keep close monitor on kids because kids don't want to tap. Like there you go. It's go crazy. And another kid's just like, oh, they're not tapping cool. I'm going to keep going. And so I would stop for them. And it's like you have to have that mentality with adults too. How when kids training kids, how old were the kids are the kids that are training the kids? No, no, they're training against kids. I didn't realize, I see what you're saying. They're just, they're just having matches. They're not instructors. So it seems like if you, if you want to focus on the criticisms and if someone's hearing about CrossFit and they want to Google like, what's bad about CrossFit? Cool. You can find what's bad about CrossFit. And if you don't say what are the mitigating approaches that handle these issues, then you won't know about them. So I think it's the education of what's happening right now is getting people educated where they're like, okay, I understand what's going on, I understand what the limitations are, I understand what what guardrails need to be put in place to mitigate these things from happening. We need to do, we need to do a much better job CrossFit does at this point of educating society on the safety and efficacy of the program in general. And we need to, all the safety protocols and all the path through even to this intensity should be common knowledge to anyone interested in this style of training that like, yeah, CrossFit, Mechanics, consistency, intensity, CrossFit, they don't recommend that you go 100% when you first walk in there. They recommend you check your ego for the benefit of our affiliate owners and our gym owners to get more people into the gyms. Our job CrossFit HQ call it, we need to be telling the world all of these things on a regular basis. I truly believe that we're not, I would say doing a great job of it right now. I hope to work with our team to get us to a better spot where we are letting the world everyone know how safe it is and how good the trainers are and we have to do a better job of making the trainers better. We have to help the affiliates become better because we have to let the world know that it's a great training option because it really is and it's for anyone and everyone. I don't want to sound like I'm trying to pitch it but I've just lived it for the last 20 years but I am because it's the most effective training protocol out there and one of the things we've done is we've demystified training and what I mean by that is this notion of training being for these called the NSCA coaches and these Olympic weightlifting coaches that are on a pedestal. These movements are complex but they're accessible to all of us. You can do them, I can do them, he can do them, our kids can do them, they just need to be trained in them and they just need to have proper instruction. The funny thing is I was telling this to one of the captains I met with recently in actually in Fort Bragg. I said the deadlift, the squat, the clean and jerk, the snatch for soldiers should be just like how to break down your M4 and what I mean by that is the points of performance for all of those movements they should learn through their training at every stage of training, how to identify good movement and how to perform good movement and how to correct good movement just like they learn how to break down and service the M4. Now that's a foundational knowledge they should have and then you have experts, you have strengthening conditioning coaches just like you have armors that when you need a little more help or you want to need more knowledge you take your gun to the armor if you want to learn more about programming or learn more about movement you go to the strengthening conditioning coach. So there's there's a world where we need to educate the soldiers more on these movements and that plays back out to just this general concept of the general public. These are things that everyone should be doing and they're not hard to learn or hard to do once you have good instruction and coaches. Now CrossFit last I guess it's been two years you've mentioned a couple times you got fired. There was a like I guess an entire paradigm shift inside a CrossFit Greg Glassman who founded it he's like a I've met him before I don't I can't even say I really know him I mean I but you know just knowing about him he was kind of like this libertarian to the core kind of guy spoke his mind to a fault I would say and the reason I say that because some people like oh you can't do that you should speak your mind well if you speak your mind and it creates an outcome that you didn't really want then maybe speaking your mind you could have done a better job but you know that kind of stuff got him into trouble yeah CrossFit at some point left social media completely and just he seemed like he became increasingly like outspoken about political issues and about things that you know honestly I was looking through some of the stuff that he would say and I was like this is you know I like to talk about simple clear concise communication that people understand it wasn't always right it was always stuff like what does that actually mean what we trying to say here it ended up not working out good for him yes Greg had a way of communicating that where you talk about simple clean clear communication Greg had a way I said that wrong good nice simple clear concise yeah simple clear concise Greg had a way of not doing simple clear concise communication by design kind of to let kind of make you think and go what did he just say and have to peel layers back because he was so intelligent and he's a fucking mad scientist genius he did that deliberately and yes kind of at the end of the day that did catch up with him because he in the tweet what he said was definitely misunderstood by what his intent was with it and it got him in a lot of trouble and a lot of his concepts were he had to dive in a layer deeper to really understand what he's trying to say but but he didn't have what he didn't he didn't want to dumb his talk down he wanted to elevate his speech and let people kind of come up and figure it out and one one approach I'm not going to say it was right or wrong but that's the way he he liked to do it he liked to communicate so he communicates himself out of a job kind of you actually became CEO for what a month something like yeah like a month and a half at that point he hadn't he had not sold the company and so he he did the tweet got in a lot of trouble over that and then ended up stepping back still on the company put me in a CEO and then there was some other stuff that started coming out and more attention was drawn to him they're they piled on him and then he there's a lot more pressure to sell there's actually a phase where I think had this second round of attacks not come at him had it just been the original tweet that he would have had a better chance call it surviving as owner with me as CEO and then getting out on the other side but the second barrage of of call it attacks really just got him to a place where like okay I'm going to sell this thing and he he put a number out there internally or not even to the team but amongst himself and his inner team and someone met it and so he ended up selling the company and when he sold it the the team who bought it the guy who led the effort to buy the team was like hey I'll put myself in a CEO I'm like yeah I get it dude he just bought the company so like I had no once I knew there was talk of selling going on I had no like aspirations to fight for the position or to like I'm gonna stay here regardless because I'm a realist I knew what that represented so that guy comes in this company buys the company company buys CrossFit they put in this new CEO he didn't last that long either right I mean how long was he there for maybe a year and a half if that he I don't remember to get that timeline but he ended up firing me and then shortly after that he he left and then shortly after that I came back and you know for me a lot of this drama stuff this is a lack of a better word drama I know it's your life right yeah I hate to just like paint it as like oh it's just a bunch of drama and it is a bunch of drama like that's what it is it's freaking drama and the whole time I was kind of like looking at it thinking it's a lot of drama but still kind of because again I'm sitting here with a CrossFit gym that I've had for 15 years it's like where is this going yeah and you know I'm not a very I don't I don't overreact to things I kind of let things play out and see what's gonna happen and and finally you you know as this new CEO came on board don't how do you say his last name fall fall fall don't fall comes on board he actually went to the Naval Academy with Wave who wrote this book with me and another book with me is and he was in the Marine Corps he he worked in a bunch of like you know tech companies as a legit like business guy with military background with leadership experience and that kind of gets us to where it is now like like right now it seems as though honestly for them the the most I've seen um and I think you know when you talk about glassman I think his approach like you talk about his from approach with like communications he also had a weird approach with leadership you know like it was like hey we're doing it like uh almost again I said libertarian but that was also applied to to the leadership like oh if you're good you're do good and your gym will do good and if you're not then your gym will fail and that's the way to and it will you know the brand will live on because the bad people will fail in the good when maybe there's a better way to do things like you're talking about like someone's a shitty trainer yep we shouldn't let him have a gym if the gym is not have a certain standard we shouldn't let it be there but he didn't do that yeah so now it's so so to me I was always kind of you know again I've got my own gym here I'm doing my thing which is kind of also in line with that attitude like hey we're right we're not following your protocol like I got my own gym like we're we're gonna do it how we're gonna do it so I was kind of okay with that not thinking about the fact that if you got someone that's a knucklehead running a gym it can be problematic in the brand a bad name but that was his attitude I would say now I think uh it is a high point for me from my vision of CrossFit over the last however many years it's been and 15 years for me is that right there's it been 25 it's a long time that I've been around uh yeah I guess it's 15 or 16 years this is the time it seems like the the clearest vision the best quality the unified goals it seems like things are as good as they have ever been for CrossFit right now I believe things are really good for CrossFit right now um Don Don Fall was a great hire by the board a great great decision in terms of just someone who their background specifically you know the Navy time or I'm sorry the uh naval academy and then the Marine Corps time and then what he did after that in the Silicon Valley he checked a lot of boxes and he what I mean by that is like here's someone that definitely um can relate to a lot of the staff a lot of the people like myself who have military backgrounds a lot of our community is you look at our roots and our history it kind of is this counter culture seal-like movement in the beginning that grew too much more than that but having someone with his experience in this role showed an awareness and appreciation for where we've been and who we are that is powerful and since he's been here yeah he's he's done a really great job in terms of bringing our team together kind of um galvanizing our mission and giving us clear vision he he is a much different leader than Greg I would say Greg wasn't even a leader at times he he was a leader of a movement but um I mean to be honest we key and I we are good friends we're still friends this day I talked to him on a regular basis we had a complex relationship we had a wild ride together just as as friends and as uh business uh or as boss and employee um his style and my style or our style of leadership was very different and um and that um cause problems at times and even some of the crazy things he did in the past um with like the social media and some of those things you talked about you know like um to say that the team was on board or to say that there were things that we were doing as a company or things that he was saying as a company that we were uh supporting and on board with and bought in on it would I would be lying if I said that I mean he and he was he was the sole owner and so people would always tell me that he's the sole owner so he could do whatever he wants that was true and he did real and uh and uh and I and the problem with that too is a lot of us because it was such a pub it's not your local um construction company you know what I mean it's a global brand that um represented a lot of employees represents a lot of affiliates and so the things he did at times was definitely in let's call it isolation of a lot of the team members being on board yeah and what when you mentioned the like the seal teams counter culture the the the rebel nature which is absolutely true that's that's part of who we are but what I saw and I'm sure you saw this too the change and the professionalization of the seal teams as we grew and as the war continued and as we got bigger and as we had more people and as we had more visibility we had to become more and more professional yep and it seems like that's that's what the transition is happening now and has been going on for the last you know six months to a year with CrossFit and and I'll tell you what it's been awesome for me um you know we I was actually trying because we have been talking with CrossFit and Jaco Fuel for like the last I don't know that's what's trying to figure I don't know where it started at some point there was well when I saw you at Bobby's um memorial right you had mentioned that you guys were talking and then I dug in with our team and um at that point it was early in the early stages of development yeah and the connection was so natural right like like here we have Jaco Fuel we make supplements to make you perform better we make protein we make energy drinks we make like that's what we do and I here I am had a CrossFit GIMPS in 2007 like it it CrossFit to me as I mentioned was something that was always trying to benefit the world and make people better and I've gotten a bunch of people to do CrossFit over the years and to to try and make them better and Jaco Fuel is the same thing like we're here we are trying to help people optimize their performance in whatever realm that they're in and so you have this real obvious kind of unified attitude at both companies of like hey we got two companies that are trying to help people get better and um I thought that was cool and again I'm not exactly I don't know who reached out to who first I don't think it was I mean I don't I don't know where it came from and I remember my if they would ask me this two years ago two years ago I would have been like hey man like I don't know there's a lot of there's a lot of polarization around it there's a lot of people that that hate on it and a lot of negative feelings about it and there's a lot of positive feelings too and we're gonna end up in this weird world uh but but since the timing was good and I'm looking at where everything's at and I see the progress being made for me was like the perfect time for to kind of join forces pretty awesome yeah we're definitely uh the last few years we've been on our heels and maybe even before the last two years what I mean by that is just um working to pull ourselves up um specifically the last two years after the the glassman after the tweet incident but even before that we shut down our social media we had shut off a lot of our media creation and when you think about at that time um as a long time affiliate owner you're an affiliate owner other affiliate owners what value or what is CrossFit doing for me if we're shutting off our mega mouthpiece our mega areas to communicate with the world the safety and efficacy of the program and and we're not doing that anymore then what are you doing you just taking my money and putting or are letting me use the name and that there became a point when that wasn't enough and so yeah the the whole shutdowns of the social media was not on not a fan of and I did not think that did any favors and it and then obviously the transition and that phase we were just clawing our way back and now you are right it is it feels like we're in a much better place and an area to uh to grow on and expand from when I was fired we talked about this briefly I uh I lived it out publicly and that was a weird like just like what I mean by that is like everybody knew it wasn't like I worked for again that construction company example a construction company it's I got fired and I had to you know I could go home and deal with it however I wanted but like the whole CrossFit world knew and that was interesting it was um I definitely wish I could get fired and not have the whole world have to know again that ever happens again but I think those days are gone um so being in this position in this with this call it spotlight it's um it's a burden I mean not a burden but it's like it's a weight it's like you know I don't mean a burden in how I am or how I act because how I act or how I am is consistent and the same regardless of if I was popular in the community or not popular how I work and how I conduct business is the same but there's this extra weight of like um the eyeballs the the attacks and I didn't cover this early but in terms of the attacks like way early on I just stopped looking and I drew a couple rules for myself with social media early early on one I was never going to comment so even to this day on any of my platforms I don't respond to anything I just feel like it's a slippery slope and two um early early on there was a bunch of haters and um that had blogs or whatnot and they'd come after us and one of them I forgot which one it was he posted something and my wife at the time or she's still my wife but at the time she was training at CrossFit Coronado and he had pulled a picture from the website from their website of her training and posted it and went after her form but didn't cite her name or didn't say it was but he was coming after CrossFit and us with an image of her and I was fucking pissed off and I didn't know if he must have known and he was doing that to get at me but at that point I was like I will never put my family out there and that's another thing I've had like this wall of like I don't post pictures of them or with them I don't um because I don't want to have to deal with anyone saying anything and how it's going to make me react to that so the best way I can handle it is just nope they're not out there and I keep the private part of my life completely private and so what I do put out there or what I do show is super deliberate is super thought through it's uh it's not by accident I've actually I have a second um I have another Instagram account I don't even use my main one that much anymore where because I'm into shooting as I mentioned I just post hunting and shooting stuff and it's like hey if you're into that stuff you can go watch me do that and see that there and I don't even have to put it on my main account because um that stuff obviously is is polarizing so and let me rephrase that I don't put it out in a polarizing way like I'm not like posting stuff and talking about the second amendment or talking about any of these issues going on I just post videos of me doing my passion what you like to do what I like to do yeah yeah it's funny because like I I only I I from my perspective like oh I saw you got fired but like that was it doesn't know it was no drama for me yeah yeah I watch you get fired but the the thing that was kind of weird for me is like I I've known you I guess now we've confirmed since 2007 yep um you didn't I was just a random team guy I wasn't like some like author or social media person I was just a normal dude and since day one you were just like cool uh like I remember you say oh you want to come to this thing I'd email you once every three years it's funny you say that that's what someone asked me like how do you know jacquire I'd say I'd responded with every few years the emails we asked for a spot to seminar I want to miss trainers once every three years that email and be like hey bro hope everything's cool yep I see there's a level one cert in San Diego I need to get recertified you'd be like yep you're in yep that was it no no reason and this was when the either I was still in the teams and was just you know like you had no reason to do this other than you were just a good dude that was just trying to help brother out right and so that's my been my interaction with you and then I'd go and you know I'd see you there and you know what's going on we talked about whatever and then carry on yep wasn't like well he hasn't called me a while like you had every you actually I'm the because I'm a I'm I don't communicate with people yeah like I don't respond to people like I don't I don't have a bunch of uh you know I don't you're not going to hear from you on your birthday like that kind of thing and so I would reach out to you like hey I need to go this thing or hey can we send a guy to that and you like kept cool all done yep again for no reason other than just like we met you seem cool I guess I seem cool we're considered each other to be cool we're good yep and that's so when I would see people like getting some people like getting crazy about you I was like bro what is what's going on and you know I I think that just um I guess that's a little bit of the nature of the beast when you're in a position like you're in people are gonna find things to attack and and look for reasons to try and bring you down and bring down what you're doing um I guess as part of the joy the fitness the fitness is polarizing in its nature that's true right there's a nutrition right well this fitness and nutrition but this specific crossfit this style of fitness is even polarizing with the fitness and then you find someone in it Greg or myself at the top and people who are leading it and then they become easy targets because you just don't want to attack the brand you want to attack the people you know it's funny about all the people that attack us too it's like um I don't like well I don't like bodybuilding for one but you will never find me on any bodybuilding sites or any bodybuilding forums talking shit about bodybuilders otherwise echo would be calling you out you know what I mean so like for yoga I'm not a yoga fan although I will say big picture I appreciate both of those activities for people being in them and being fit and trying to change their lives but my point is it's a unique person or a special person who doesn't like something and then goes over to their pages and goes over to their forums and starts blasting it it's it's a horrible person actually is what it is yeah that's definitely not a good way to go through life you know as you're as your fourth grade teacher told you and your dad told you and your mom told you and your principal told you if you don't have anything nice to say don't say it man and that proves to be true um we got this little collab going I guess jocco fuel across fit that's what we got going on uh hey if you have a gym a crossfit gym and you want to carry jocco fuel you can email jf sales at joccofuel.com uh we're doing some if you want to try jocco fuel we're doing uh like uh there's terms in the in the retail world of selling by one get one at 50% off joccofuel.com and

some speed where we're at right now yeah absolutely um we're excited we're excited to be working with a brand like yours it's been years i think in the making and as you said it's the right time it's an awesome time um echo yes sir do you any questions i do bodybuilding questions no we'll skip down so when you're in the navy you can have another job or is that like an exception i don't get it usually no well i know and we know another guy that did that and i was all confused i was like wait how are you still in the navy if you're you literally have like this company in this job or whatever like so what's the what's the deal it it depends at what occasion and sometimes you have to be really formal and get like written permission all the way up to your CO and and oftentimes if i was not at that role i had there was no way it could have been done like if i was at a regular seal team where i was deploying and training i could not have done the role unique time unique circumstance unique leadership that allowed me to so so it's essentially what you can get away with with varying degrees of officiality kind of a scenario yeah that sounds about right yeah and it's always it's always going to be on a not to interfere basis right in other words no matter what happens this navy job is the absolute priority sorry i'd be careful that makes sense yeah cool man great to meet you in person yeah nice to meet you too right on uh crossfit.com is where you can find out about crossfit you can find it on twitter instagram facebook at crossfit dav your on instagram you're on twitter

stronger and fitter which helps them with every aspect of their life that is appreciated thank you thank you and with that Dave Castro has left the building echo yes you did not get to go as deep into body building especially he kind of came at it too little bit he literally said he didn't like bodybuilding you know he said he respects it as um no he said he didn't like it at first sure and then i think i don't think he said he said he respected yoga i think no bro i think he respect yoga but doesn't respect bodybuilding he said i'm not down for bodybuilding but i don't go hate on him in their forms okay cool cool have you ever been to a bodybuilding form on the interwebs no and no disappointing i don't think i figured you'd be all up in there i don't spend much time in forms to say the honest truth check yeah they seem like they might be a place for negativity maybe i don't know well that's what it seems like yeah free free for all well i know that fitness as a space if you will fitness i don't care crossfit bodybuilding of functional fitness fitness powerlifting powerlifting the whole gig um is a very uh like competitive real like it's controversial country for like yeah like if there's gonna be some controversy that comes out they're gonna brother gonna talk about it they're gonna hate on it they're passionate they're gonna be on a passion in the talk yeah there's a lot of different approaches to fitness and there's a lot of different approaches to different goals within fitness as well it's like like how you kind of started to talk about diet okay fitness diet how to raise kids political political stuff and religion five that's the big five we call them the big five is that your big fibers that are a more known big five it's a known big five not called the big five big five something else but called five topics to avoid it Thanksgiving dinner what are they again religion okay hold on so down religion okay yep there be some controversy around that diet okay yep there's definitely controversy around that exercise for a little while in my life my wife told me don't talk about diet with her friends right this is in the old school days yep I was ahead of the curve she would be like just don't can you talk about this please yeah I'd be like all right cool yeah plus they don't know yeah wouldn't any okay so we got real diet religion politics politics certainly fitness fitness yes how to raise kids interesting yeah I'm gonna say that's probably all true yeah so yeah if there's gonna be some drama in any industry and you select one of those industries you can there's a high likelihood that the drama is gonna be sky high yeah and look there's a drama this is what you know we we talked about and I I didn't mean to diminish the drama that that Dave you know actually lived through but from my perspective it is it was a bunch of drama like you know I'm watching it like jeez what are these people going crazy attacking each other and all the stuff so the good thing is and as I said if they would have come if we would have started talking two years ago like jock of fuel and crossfit I would have not been too fired up for it and who knows what they would have been I don't know but I'm just saying from my perspective two years ago three years ago it's like there's a lot of mayhem going on but they certainly have moved and are I think they're in a much more positive place right now and I think it's gonna be awesome because crossfit is gateway to fitness for so many people so many people and I think that's gonna be awesome I think that people hearing about it more is gonna get more people to go and try it I think the fact that they've gotten better as coaches and as instructors is gonna be beneficial to everybody and yeah I'm looking forward to see where this goes we got I mean the stuff that we're making right now too I don't feel as like gonna be so beneficial we got I'm actually drinking some hydration right now have you tried the hydrate yet hydrate to tackle hydrate I know my first one today do you try to today I didn't oh you haven't even mixed it up yet yeah that's coming June ninth June ninth I think is when is when the hydration is coming out it's awesome we got time war we got joint warfare we got the protein cookies we got peach we were kind of so many good so much good stuff that we're coming out with right now you know what I think is gonna be and I was talking to Jason Calipa do you know that is yeah I was talking in the other day and he's because he's got a couple like CrossFit gyms and he advises a bunch of people and he's a former CrossFit champion he's like yeah the ready to drink protein yeah and the go to it's the same it's it's such a good combo to go oh I'm going to do the activity go right I'm done with the activity I need to recover moch get the full protein full protocol yeah actually this is what this is my protocol now yeah by the way and haven't like here at victory MMA when you can just get done and you're walking your car and you're drinking a moch yeah you feel the goodness when I crack a go like I walk to my eyes I'm walking I have a is this bougie to have a beverage refrigerator in your house yes okay I am admitting to a level of bourgeoisie yeah I have a beverage refrigerator in my house that is filled with beverages those beverages are go and moch just beverages just beverage it is okay though that's what I have yeah but when I'm going to come to the gym I'm walking I go bass my beverage refrigerator my bourgeoisie beverage refrigerator and I get a go and I open it and I drive here and it's like it's the perfect time and then I get here get changed by the time I'm stepping on the mat I feel it I have the exact same protocol oh essentially where yeah I actually can't really go anywhere that's that takes more than 15 minutes without bringing a go pretty much like they're very few exceptions we went someplace me in the fam go come down to train today go yeah all day you know what's another I don't you call the sleeper I don't even think it's a sleeper the greens the greens are good this is the thing that well greens aren't known to be good that's a thing to be bad greens is a kind like hey look I don't want to eat a bowl of water from a roughage you know in real life so I'm going to take a cool like legitimate supplement but you got to understand it's just like it's just a bunch of greens kind of mashed up and I'm like yeah I said but they're not known for taste that's the thing so it's like okay if you're gonna rough it at least rough it just for a little while so it's like ever gonna go through it cool we've all accepted that that's kind of the original protocol they you know they'll be like hey what should we tell people about the greens this is me imitating everyone in shock before I'll see your no it's the combination of Joe Moss of Pete of Brian of all them they when I combine all their voices together they sound like hey what do you think we should so now say like hey what do you think we should let's take a good thing to say what should we tell people about green and I go hey tell people your greens don't have to taste like dirt yeah that's how's that your greens don't have to taste like dirt tell them that because because greens taste like dirt yeah no reason for that yeah there's no reason for that dirt and moss like dirt and moss yeah for sure right you know when you're a little kid let's face it you were looking at a piece of moss it looked like it might taste good right that's how we know what dirt moss tastes like yeah exactly and then for some reason people thought just because you ate it when you were five yeah you're still gonna gut through it no no reason for it no greens peach greens anyways that's what's going on we uh have a little partnership that we formed up with CrossFit so if you're gonna start doing CrossFit you're gonna need to feel yourself get yourself some jockofiljockfield.com go check that out like I said we got we're doing a little special to welcome the Crossfitters out there into the fold by one get one 50% off free shipping over nine nine bucks that's a big deal because shipping can cost a lot but if you buy more than nine in bucks three you're good to go so there you go go check that out jockofiljock.com also check out origin USA.com because origin USA.com we have stuff that's made in America and there's a lot of people right now in the world that are pro human rights let me ask you this have you met anyone that's pro slavery? no well no okay I have not I have not met another human in my lifetime that was pro slavery yeah and yet there's slavery right now yep there's slavery right now it's true and I can tell you where it is it's if you look at the tag on your clothing and it says made in China they might as well say made by chained people because that's what's going on over there. don't do that don't support slavery support don't support environmental disaster which is all when you have a factory in America there's inspectors that come to see what's happening to see what kind of waste is coming out of your factory and I'm talking about the factories that I have there's inspectors that come and you're not allowed to put certain things chemicals into the ground or chemicals into the air you're not allowed to do it there's rules and regulations there's no rules and regulations overseas they're just dumping their chemicals into the water into the air they don't care so for all those reasons go to origin USA and get yourself a pair of jeans by the way best jeans you'll ever get. I was gonna say just in case a small chance comes around in your head that you care about how how you look in some jeans I throw in that reason as well or if you care how you function yes sir because you might be into the fashion it's over on this side of table we're in a function okay there you go go to origin USA dot com. it's true also jocke a store it's called jocke store go jocke store dot com when you look we're on the path look whether you do crossfit you get to both running lifting bodybuilding whatever actually I'm gonna be on I don't know that I do bodybuilding I I actually know that I will know that wait wait wait let's say this your your crossfit modality sure includes bodybuilding right and am I wrong well let me think okay so does shoulder press dumbbells okay I already answered so if I did four sets of 15 with the bodybuilding and bodybuilding and rest between bodybuilding two failure or almost to failure that's bodybuilding how shoulder press I mean I'll ask you that's bodybuilding right what is the purpose as you like say why are you doing that to make my shoulders strong so make your shoulders what to make your shoulders what strong is there any concern about size look am I going into the fights at the 12 kind of scenario wait what did I do 15 yeah he said 15 oh hey look if they happen to get bigger amen cool yes I will consider a lot of weight and it's a win yes sir but I do do deep squats yep I do do a clean impress yeah good good as part of a met con this is my routine by so a man I'm doing you're good you're good you're good bodybuilding hey I will say this I do bodybuilding type exercises like tricep pull downs you do them curls curls I do those things good why look do I do also do cleans yes yeah do I also do presses yes but I found that keeping your like smaller muscle groups also engaged is useful yeah and let's face it we want to have guns let's go but yes okay good okay good I do some bodybuilding movement I don't do because you consider the whole routine in the spirit of all these modalities as it were consider the whole routine if it's a hybrid of bodybuilding strength training Olympic lifting clean impress clean and jerk as part of a met con so that's an Olympic lifting there's some crossfit in there because it's some stuff is for time sometimes it's am rat what's the as yeah yeah yeah sometimes it's that so there's some crossfit in there kind of a thing and then what else would there be the bodybuilding stuff for sure so okay as a comprehensive program what is that kind of everything right which kind of makes a crossfit and then I do the job yeah I'm sure yeah yeah I love you what there you go but either way hey look it's part of the protocol it's part of the routine same thing with the whole you know nutrition diet exercise is part of the whole routine it's part of the path yeah I see exactly what you're saying back to jackel store if you want to represent while you're on this path you see

also have a we have an online trading academy for life to interact with other human beings you know if you want to interact with other human beings you you need to learn it it's not a natural thing I was talking to tie you know SD tie I do sandy he used to be he used to he's transitioned he was main tie but now he's become SD tie I hear good so SD tie I was talking to him and you know he was talking about having conversations with people and how he's starting to become aware of oh these are the things that I've heard you talking about and now I can see them and I can detach enough to make sure that I am taking the right approach yeah that is what you learn on extremotorship dot com how to interact with other people how to converse with them how to ask earnest questions how to see their point of view how to influence them how to allow yourself to be all these things are in there a little bit of magic it's kind of like jujitsu I was gonna say bray you made such the other day you made a good point where you're like hey if you know how to if you're doing all this stuff or whatever imagine how and I made maybe kind of go down this little whatever psychological rep where and you're right it's same as jujitsu same as fitness lifting weights it's the same as like reading even something as fundamental as reading imagine if you were the only one who knew how to read right now just all of a sudden or let's say you're only one of like eight people in the whole wide world or whatever they knew how to read you know how how easy things would be for you compared to everybody else you're the only person that knew how to do jujitsu if you're only a person that knew how to do an overhead squat and you go challenging people all over the squat context well let's say if you were the only person who lifted weights and ran and did good nutrition first everyone else just ate the normal stuff didn't lift at all you know how much stronger it would be it would be easy life would be easy for you in a way just walking around ruling the planet it's it's kind of the same it is the same thing yeah it's a little it's the same thing it's actually what's different is if if I know jujitsu powerful skill to have powerful skill to have if I know it when do I get to use it right you're right I get to use it if you want to use it with me you come to my gym or if we happen to be in the streets and you happen to assault me maybe I get to use some jujitsu if it's strength training maybe a car is on top of the baby and I get to lift it up right maybe we're not gonna set that up on purpose but this extreme ownership calm this is daily interaction with other human beings this is figuring out what you need to do to maneuver correctly through life so that you can build relationships where your life is moving forward and getting better rather than moving backward and getting worse that simple simple simple question when has it been good that you had an antagonistic relationship with someone like like oh I don't like my boss okay does it help you that that you're fighting oh I don't like this peer of mine does it help you that you don't like each other I don't like this subordinate mine does it help you that you don't like each other yeah I don't like my neighbor well how does that work out I don't like the garbage man okay well how does that work out if you if you have a good relationship with your garbage man guess what some of the garbage spills out he runs out of the truck and throws in he takes care of you bro that's so true because I'm telling you bro you ever see I'm telling this guy to be like come on let's face that garbage truck some guy can be rough oh yeah garbage like overflows and flies inside probably he's not getting out of his truck right he has many more garbage things to take care of no but when you line up your cans correctly and when you're out there like maybe maybe once every other week you're out there and you're helping just give him a little help man you can hear the garbage truck coming let's face it get out there you do that everyone's finally build that little relationship all of a sudden he's taking a bit more gentle with your cans and you're gonna take him out of the city when they break it's a problem your whole life could be better it's true so that's the kind of thing when you start thinking about it you start making every aspect of your life better because you got a good relationship with your garbage man you got a good relationship with your wife with your kids with your peers with your boss with your subordinates with the other team over there the other department the other division they're like oh hey draco what's going on how much what's going on with you oh yeah that's a big deal it's true it's just gonna make everyone's life better so go to extremism ownership dot com learn a little bit of the magic magic and if you want to help service members active and retired you want to
